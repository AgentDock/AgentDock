# Thank You Email Writer

I need to write a thoughtful thank you email that feels genuine and personal, not like a generic template.

I am thanking [RECIPIENT_NAME] for [THANK_YOU_REASON:select:a job interview,a gift they gave me,help or a favor they did,a meeting or conversation,a referral or introduction,a recommendation or reference,hosting me or their hospitality,a business opportunity,mentorship or advice,attending my event].

Here is what specifically happened that I want to acknowledge: [SPECIFIC_DETAILS]

My relationship with this person is [RELATIONSHIP:select:professional - we work together,professional - external contact,personal friend,family member,acquaintance,mentor or senior figure,new connection].

The tone should be [TONE:select:warm and heartfelt,professional and appreciative,casual and friendly,formal and respectful].

If there is anything I want to mention about next steps or follow-up: [FOLLOW_UP?]

Write a complete thank you email including a subject line. Make sure to reference the specific details I provided so the email feels personal and not like it could be sent to anyone. Keep it [LENGTH:select:brief - 2-3 sentences,short - one paragraph,medium - 2 short paragraphs] and end with an appropriate closing that matches our relationship.
