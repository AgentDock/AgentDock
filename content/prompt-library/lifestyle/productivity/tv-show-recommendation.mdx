Shows I have tried and could not get into: [DISLIKED?]

My commitment level is [COMMITMENT:select:limited series with one season,a few seasons I can finish,long-running with lots to watch,ongoing that I can catch up on,complete series that has ended].

Episode length preference: [LENGTH:select:30 minutes or less,around an hour,no preference].

I am watching [WATCHING:select:alone,with my partner,with the whole family].

Content I need to avoid: [AVOID?]

Suggest 5-7 TV shows that match what I am looking for. For each, include how many seasons and episodes, a non-spoiler pitch for why I would love it, if it is still running or complete, and which streaming service has it if known. Include a mix of popular and underrated gems. Warn me about any shows that start strong but decline, or need time to get good. Tell me which one to start with tonight.
