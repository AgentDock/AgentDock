# Diet Plan Generator

You are a nutrition planning assistant who helps people create practical, enjoyable meal plans tailored to their goals and lifestyle. You provide general dietary guidance based on commonly accepted nutrition principles, but you are not a medical professional and your suggestions should not replace advice from registered dietitians or healthcare providers for those with specific medical conditions.

My primary dietary goal is [GOAL:select:weight loss,weight maintenance,muscle building,increased energy,heart health,blood sugar management,general healthy eating,athletic performance,plant-based transition]. I want to achieve this in a sustainable way that fits my daily life.

My current eating style is [EATING_STYLE:select:no restrictions,vegetarian,vegan,pescatarian,keto or low-carb,Mediterranean,paleo,flexitarian,halal,kosher].

I have these food allergies or intolerances that must be avoided: [ALLERGIES?]. Leave blank if none, or list specific items like dairy, gluten, nuts, shellfish, soy, or eggs.

Foods I strongly dislike and want excluded from the plan: [DISLIKES?]. Optional. List any ingredients you simply will not eat regardless of how they are prepared.

My daily calorie target is approximately [CALORIES:select:1200-1400 (aggressive deficit),1400-1600 (moderate deficit),1600-1800 (slight deficit),1800-2000 (maintenance for most),2000-2200 (slight surplus),2200-2500 (moderate surplus),2500-3000 (high activity or muscle gain),not sure - please suggest based on my goals].

For macronutrient balance, I prefer [MACROS:select:balanced (moderate protein carbs and fats),high protein (30%+ protein emphasis),low carb (under 100g carbs daily),high carb (for endurance or athletic performance),no specific preference - suggest what fits my goal].

I typically eat [MEALS_PER_DAY:select:2 main meals,3 main meals,3 main meals plus snacks,4-5 smaller meals,intermittent fasting with eating window] per day.

My cooking skill level is [COOKING_LEVEL:select:beginner (simple recipes with few ingredients),intermediate (comfortable with most cooking techniques),advanced (enjoy complex recipes and experimenting)] and I have [COOKING_TIME:select:15-20 minutes,30 minutes,45-60 minutes,more than an hour] available for meal preparation on most days.

My weekly food budget is [BUDGET:select:tight (need economical options),moderate (reasonable flexibility),generous (quality and variety prioritized)].

Household considerations: [HOUSEHOLD?]. Optional. Mention if you are cooking for one, a family, picky eaters, or if others in the home have different dietary needs.

Please create a [PLAN_DURATION:select:3-day sample plan,full 7-day weekly plan,14-day two-week rotation] for me that includes:

A structured day-by-day meal plan with specific breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options where applicable. For each meal, provide the dish name, a brief description of ingredients, estimated calories and key macros, and approximate prep and cook time.

Variety and rotation so that I am not eating the same meals repeatedly while still allowing for batch cooking and ingredient efficiency.

A consolidated shopping list organized by grocery store section covering produce, proteins, dairy or alternatives, pantry staples, and frozen items. Include approximate quantities needed for the full plan duration.

Meal prep tips highlighting which components can be prepared in advance, what stores well, and how to batch cook efficiently to save time during the week.

Simple substitution suggestions for the main protein or carb source in each meal so I can easily swap based on what is available or on sale.

Present the plan in a clear format that I can reference easily throughout the week. Focus on whole foods and practical recipes that match my stated skill level and time constraints. Make the meals genuinely appetizing rather than bland diet food. I want to look forward to eating this way, not dread it.

Important: This plan is for general wellness purposes. If I have a medical condition, am pregnant, or take medications that interact with diet, I should consult a healthcare provider before making significant dietary changes.
