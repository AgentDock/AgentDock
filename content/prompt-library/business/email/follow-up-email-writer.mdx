# Follow-Up Email Writer

I need to write a follow-up email that gets a response without coming across as pushy or desperate.

This is a follow-up for [FOLLOW_UP_TYPE:select:sales prospect,job interview,unpaid invoice,meeting request,networking connection,proposal sent,collaboration inquiry,customer check-in,event invitation,general inquiry].

Our previous interaction was about [PREVIOUS_INTERACTION] and it happened [TIME_SINCE_CONTACT:select:yesterday,2-3 days ago,1 week ago,2 weeks ago,1 month ago,more than a month ago]. This is follow-up number [FOLLOW_UP_NUMBER:select:1 - first follow-up,2 - second follow-up,3 or more - multiple attempts already].

My relationship with this person is [RELATIONSHIP:select:cold - never met,warm - met once or twice,established - ongoing relationship,former colleague or client].

The outcome I want from this email is [DESIRED_OUTCOME].

The tone should be [TONE:select:professional and formal,friendly but professional,casual and warm,urgent but respectful].

If there is any new information or value I can add to make this follow-up more relevant, it is: [NEW_VALUE_ADD?]

Write a complete follow-up email including a subject line that references our previous conversation. Keep the email concise at [LENGTH:select:2-3 sentences,1 short paragraph,2 short paragraphs] and end with a clear but low-pressure call to action. The email should acknowledge their busy schedule while still moving toward my goal.
