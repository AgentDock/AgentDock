# Bedtime Story Creator

I want to create a special bedtime story that features my child and captures their imagination.

My child's name is [CHILD_NAME] and they are [CHILD_AGE:select:2-3 years old,4-5 years old,6-7 years old,8-10 years old].

They love [INTERESTS] (such as dinosaurs, princesses, space, animals, superheroes, etc.).

I would like the story to gently teach about [LESSON:select:being brave,being kind to others,trying new things,dealing with big feelings,the importance of friendship,believing in yourself,being patient,sharing and taking turns,telling the truth,no specific lesson - just fun].

The story should have a [MOOD:select:magical and whimsical,adventurous and exciting,calm and soothing,funny and silly,cozy and comforting] feeling.

If there are any friends, pets, or family members to include: [ADDITIONAL_CHARACTERS?]

Create a complete bedtime story that is the right length and complexity for my child's age. Make my child the hero of the story. Include vivid but calming imagery, especially toward the end to help them wind down. The story should have a clear beginning, middle, and gentle ending that leaves them feeling safe and sleepy. Add a few spots where I can use different voices or sound effects to make it more engaging.
