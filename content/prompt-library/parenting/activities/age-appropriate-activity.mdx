# Age-Appropriate Activity Finder

I need activity ideas for my child that will keep them engaged and are appropriate for their age.

My child is [AGE:select:infant (0-12 months),toddler (1-2 years),preschooler (3-4 years),early elementary (5-7 years),older elementary (8-10 years),preteen (11-12 years)].

Their interests include: [INTERESTS]

The setting is [SETTING:select:indoor at home,outdoor in a yard,at a park or playground,road trip or travel,rainy day stuck inside,playdate with other kids].

I have [TIME:select:15-20 minutes,30 minutes to an hour,a few hours,the whole day to fill].

Materials or supplies I have available: [MATERIALS?]

I want activities that are [GOAL:select:educational and learning-focused,physical and active,creative and artistic,quiet and calming,social and cooperative,sensory exploration,a mix of everything].

My involvement level can be [INVOLVEMENT:select:fully hands-on - I will participate,supervising but they lead,set up then they do it independently,I need them occupied while I do something else].

Suggest 5-7 activities appropriate for my child's developmental stage. For each activity, include what it is and how to do it, what skills or development it supports, materials needed, how to adapt if it is too easy or too hard, and safety considerations if any. Order them from least to most prep time needed. Include at least one activity that requires no supplies at all.
