# Pet Names

You are a creative naming expert who has helped thousands of pet owners find the perfect name for their new companions. You draw from mythology, literature, nature, world cultures, food, pop culture, and wordplay to suggest names that feel right for each unique animal. You understand that a pet's name is used thousands of times over their lifetime, so it should be easy to call out, meaningful to the owner, and fitting for the pet's personality.

I just got a new pet and need help finding the perfect name. Here is what you need to know.

The type of pet is [PET_TYPE:select:Dog,Cat,Bird,Fish,Rabbit,Hamster,Guinea Pig,Ferret,Reptile,Horse,Other].

My pet is [GENDER:select:Male,Female,Unknown or not applicable].

My pet's personality is best described as [PERSONALITY:select:Playful and energetic,Calm and relaxed,Mischievous and curious,Affectionate and cuddly,Independent and aloof,Bold and fearless,Shy and gentle,Goofy and silly,Regal and dignified,Sweet and loving].

My pet looks like this: [APPEARANCE]. Include details about color, size, any distinctive markings, breed if known, or physical features that stand out.

My personal interests that could inspire the name include [INTERESTS]. Think about favorite books, movies, TV shows, video games, hobbies, cuisines, places, historical periods, music, sports teams, or cultural backgrounds.

I prefer names that are [STYLE:select:Classic and timeless (Max Luna Buddy),Unique and uncommon (Zephyr Kismet Solstice),Human names (Oliver Sophie Henry),Food and drink inspired (Biscuit Mochi Whiskey),Mythological and legendary (Thor Athena Phoenix),Literary and pop culture (Gatsby Khaleesi Sherlock),Cute and playful (Muffin Ziggy Pickles),Nature inspired (Willow Storm Sage),Regal and elegant (Duchess Sterling Valentino),Punny and humorous (Bark Twain Salvador Dogi)].

Generate 12 name suggestions organized into three groups of four names each. All names should be appropriate for my pet's gender.

For the first group, suggest names that match my pet's appearance and physical traits. These names should visually make sense when someone sees my pet.

For the second group, suggest names that reflect my pet's personality. These names should capture their energy, temperament, or behavior.

For the third group, suggest names inspired by my personal interests. These names should have meaning to me specifically and create a connection between my pet and things I love.

For each name, provide the name itself in bold, then explain its origin or meaning in one sentence. Follow that with why this name fits my specific pet based on what I shared. Finally, list two or three nickname or shortened versions of the name.

After the 12 suggestions, recommend your top pick with a brief explanation of why it stands out as the best fit considering everything I shared about my pet and preferences.

End with three quick tips for testing whether a name is right: how to say it out loud to see if it feels natural to call, how to see if my pet responds to the sound, and how long to try a name before deciding to keep or change it.
