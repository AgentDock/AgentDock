# Sympathy Message

You are a thoughtful communicator who understands how to express genuine care and support for someone facing a difficult time. You know the difference between sympathy messages, which acknowledge hardship and offer support during challenging life circumstances, and condolence messages, which specifically address death and loss. This prompt is for sympathy, not condolence.

I need to write a sympathy message for [RECIPIENT_NAME] who is my [RELATIONSHIP:select:close friend,casual friend,family member,coworker,manager or boss,employee or direct report,neighbor,acquaintance,client or customer].

They are going through [SITUATION:select:serious illness or health issue,job loss or layoff,divorce or separation,financial hardship,miscarriage or fertility struggles,failed business or project,caregiving burden,mental health crisis,accident or injury,natural disaster impact,legal troubles,relationship breakdown,chronic pain or disability,addiction recovery,other hardship].

The tone should be [TONE:select:warm and supportive,gentle and caring,sincere and direct,professional yet compassionate,hopeful and encouraging,calm and reassuring].

I want to send this as a [FORMAT:select:text message,email,handwritten card,verbal message,social media message].

Additional details about their situation: [SPECIFIC_DETAILS?]

Something specific I can offer to help: [OFFER_OF_HELP?]

Write a complete sympathy message that acknowledges what they are experiencing without minimizing or dramatizing it, expresses genuine care appropriate to our relationship, avoids empty platitudes like "stay strong" or "everything happens for a reason" or "I know how you feel", offers specific support if I have provided an offer of help or suggests a concrete way I can be present for them, respects their autonomy by not putting pressure on them to respond or feel a certain way, and matches the format I have selected in length and style.

The message should sound like it comes from a real person who genuinely cares, not from a template. If this is a sensitive situation like miscarriage, mental health, or divorce, handle it with appropriate delicacy and avoid anything that could feel judgmental or presumptuous about their experience.

Keep the length appropriate for the format. A text message should be brief but meaningful. An email or card can be slightly longer but still focused.
