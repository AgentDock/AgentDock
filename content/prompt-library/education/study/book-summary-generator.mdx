# Book Summary Generator

I want a thorough summary of a book that captures the essential ideas so I can learn from it quickly or decide if I should read it in full.

The book I want summarized is [BOOK_TITLE] by [AUTHOR].

This book is [BOOK_TYPE:select:non-fiction or self-help,business or professional development,biography or memoir,science or technology,history or politics,philosophy or psychology,fiction or literary].

I am looking for this summary because [PURPOSE:select:I want to learn the key concepts without reading the full book,I am deciding whether to read this book,I already read it and want to reinforce what I learned,I need to discuss this book with others,I want to apply the ideas to my own life or work].

I prefer the summary to be [LENGTH:select:brief - just the essentials in a few paragraphs,moderate - a solid overview that covers the main points,comprehensive - detailed summary with chapter or section breakdowns].

Please provide a summary that includes the main thesis or central argument, the key ideas and supporting points, practical takeaways or lessons I can apply, who would benefit most from reading this book, and any notable quotes or concepts worth remembering. If this is fiction, focus on themes, character development, and what makes the book significant. Be honest about any weaknesses or criticisms of the book as well.
