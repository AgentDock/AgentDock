# Project Status Report

Generate a professional project status report for stakeholder communication.

My project is called [PROJECT_NAME] and involves [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]. The reporting period covers [REPORTING_PERIOD] and this update is intended for [AUDIENCE:select:executive leadership,client stakeholders,internal team,project steering committee,board of directors].

The current overall project status is [STATUS:select:green - on track,amber - at risk,red - blocked or critical issues]. Our original timeline targeted [TARGET_COMPLETION_DATE] and current budget stands at [BUDGET_STATUS:select:on budget,slightly over budget,significantly over budget,under budget].

During this period we accomplished the following milestones or deliverables: [KEY_ACCOMPLISHMENTS]. Work currently in progress includes [CURRENT_ACTIVITIES].

The main blockers or issues we face are [BLOCKERS_OR_ISSUES?]. Risks we are monitoring include [RISKS_AND_CONCERNS?]. Our mitigation approach for these items is [MITIGATION_ACTIONS?].

Key decisions needed from stakeholders are [DECISIONS_NEEDED?]. The priorities for next period include [NEXT_PERIOD_PRIORITIES].

Generate a status report that opens with a crisp executive summary capturing the essential health of the project in three to four sentences. Follow with a clear RAG indicator section showing status for schedule, budget, scope, and quality. Present accomplishments as concrete deliverables rather than activities. Frame blockers and risks with their business impact and proposed mitigation. Include an action items table with owner, task, and due date columns. Close with upcoming milestones and what success looks like for the next reporting period.

Write in direct professional language suitable for the specified audience. Use bullet points for scanability but ensure each point conveys substantive information. Avoid jargon that obscures meaning. The report should fit on one to two pages when formatted and give stakeholders everything they need to understand project health and make informed decisions.
