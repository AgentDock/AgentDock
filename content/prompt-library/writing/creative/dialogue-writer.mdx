# Dialogue Writer

I need help writing dialogue that sounds natural and reveals character.

The scene takes place [SCENE_SETTING] and involves [SCENE_CONTEXT].

The characters in this conversation are: [CHARACTERS] (describe each character briefly including their personality, relationship to each other, and emotional state in this scene)

The purpose of this dialogue is [PURPOSE:select:to reveal information to the reader,to develop character relationships,to create tension or conflict,to advance the plot,to provide comic relief,to create an emotional moment].

The conversation should convey [SUBTEXT] (what characters are really feeling or thinking beneath the surface).

The tone is [TONE:select:serious and dramatic,light and humorous,tense and confrontational,intimate and vulnerable,casual and everyday,awkward or uncomfortable].

The format is [FORMAT:select:novel with dialogue tags,screenplay format,stage play format,comic or graphic novel,video game dialogue].

Write the dialogue for this scene. Give each character a distinct voice and speech pattern. Use subtext so characters do not say everything directly. Include beats and action within the dialogue to show body language and reactions. Balance dialogue with brief descriptions of what is happening physically. Avoid on-the-nose dialogue where characters state exactly what they feel. Make the conversation flow naturally with interruptions, incomplete thoughts, and realistic rhythm. After the dialogue, note any techniques used and how the scene could be adjusted for different emotional impacts.
