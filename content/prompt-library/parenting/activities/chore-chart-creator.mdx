# Chore Chart Creator

I want to create a chore chart to help distribute household responsibilities and teach my kids accountability.

The children in my household are [CHILDREN_AGES] years old.

The number of children participating: [NUM_CHILDREN:select:1 child,2 children,3 children,4 or more children].

Adults in the household who will also have chores: [ADULTS?]

Our household includes: [HOUSEHOLD:select:house with yard,apartment or condo,house no yard,townhouse]

Pets we need to care for: [PETS?]

The chore frequency I want to track: [FREQUENCY:select:daily chores,weekly chores,both daily and weekly,monthly deep cleaning tasks].

Do I want to use a reward system? [REWARDS:select:yes with allowance tied to chores,yes with non-monetary rewards,yes with points or sticker system,no rewards just expectations].

Any chores the kids already do that should be included: [CURRENT_CHORES?]

Create an age-appropriate chore chart that assigns developmentally suitable tasks to each child, distributes work fairly, includes clear expectations for how each chore should be done, builds in accountability and tracking, and if requested includes a reward structure. Suggest how to introduce the system and handle resistance. Make it realistic and sustainable for our family.
