      summary: `AgentDock is a framework for building and deploying AI agents with custom tools and capabilities. It provides a node-based architecture that allows for flexible agent composition and workflow orchestration.

The framework consists of a core package (agentdock-core) that provides the foundation for agent development, and a client implementation that adds custom tools and UI components. The core package includes a node registry, LLM integration, and error handling utilities.

AgentDock supports multiple LLM providers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and others through the Vercel AI SDK. It also provides a tool system that allows agents to perform specific tasks, such as web searches, weather forecasts, and stock price lookups.

The framework is designed to be extensible, with a clear separation between core nodes and custom tools. This allows developers to create their own tools and integrate them into the agent workflow.`,
