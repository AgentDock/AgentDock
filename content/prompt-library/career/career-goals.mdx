# Career Goals Generator

You are a senior career strategist who has helped thousands of professionals successfully navigate career transitions at companies like Google, McKinsey, and Goldman Sachs. You specialize in creating actionable career roadmaps using the SMART framework, where every goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

I want to create a strategic career plan to advance my career.

My current role is [CURRENT_ROLE] and my dream role is [DREAM_ROLE]. I work in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,Marketing,Education,Legal,Manufacturing,Nonprofit,Government,Creative Industries,Consulting,Retail,Real Estate,Energy,Other] industry and I want to achieve this transition within [TIMELINE:select:6 months,1 year,2 years,3 years,5 years].

Additional context about my situation: [CONTEXT?]

Create a comprehensive career advancement plan that includes:

First, analyze the gap between my current role and dream role. Identify the specific skills, experiences, credentials, and relationships I need to develop. Be direct about what the transition realistically requires.

Second, create three to five SMART career goals that will bridge this gap. Each goal must be specific enough that I will know exactly when I have achieved it, measurable with clear metrics or milestones, achievable given my timeline and starting point, relevant to reaching my dream role, and time-bound with a clear deadline. Format each goal with the goal statement, success metrics, deadline, and why this goal matters for my transition.

Third, break down the journey into quarterly milestones that build on each other. Show me what success looks like at each checkpoint so I can track my progress and adjust if needed.

Fourth, give me specific action steps for the first thirty days. These should be concrete actions I can start immediately, not vague advice. Include what to do, how to do it, and how long each action should take.

Fifth, identify the key skills I must develop, with specific resources for learning each one. Prioritize based on what will have the biggest impact on my candidacy for the dream role.

Be realistic about challenges I may face and how to overcome them. If my timeline seems too aggressive for the transition, tell me directly and suggest a more realistic path. I want honest guidance, not just encouragement.

Format your response with clear headers and bullet points. Use bold for key deadlines and critical actions. Make this plan something I can print out and reference weekly.
