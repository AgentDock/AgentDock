# Article Summarizer

I need a quick summary of an article so I can decide if it is worth reading in full or extract the key points.

Here is the article I want summarized: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

I need this summary because [PURPOSE:select:I want to decide if the full article is worth my time,I need the key facts for research,I want to share the main points with someone else,I read it but want to remember the key takeaways,I need to understand this topic quickly for a meeting or discussion].

The summary should be [LENGTH:select:very brief - 2-3 sentences capturing the core message,short - one paragraph with main points,moderate - a few paragraphs with supporting details,detailed - comprehensive summary with all key points].

I am particularly interested in [FOCUS?] (leave blank for a general summary).

Summarize this article by starting with the main thesis or argument in one sentence. List the key supporting points or evidence. Note any data, statistics, or research cited. Capture the author's conclusions or recommendations. Highlight anything surprising or counterintuitive. If the article has clear weaknesses or biases, note them. Suggest who would benefit most from reading the full article.
