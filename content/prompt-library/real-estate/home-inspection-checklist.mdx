# Home Inspection Checklist Generator

I am preparing for a home inspection and need a thorough, customized checklist to ensure nothing critical gets overlooked. The property is a [PROPERTY_TYPE:select:single-family home,townhouse,condominium,duplex,multi-family,mobile home,historic home] built in [YEAR_BUILT:number:1900-2026], with approximately [SQUARE_FEET:number:500-10000] square feet. The home is located in a climate characterized by [CLIMATE:select:cold winters with snow,hot and humid summers,mild year-round,desert/arid conditions,coastal/salt air exposure,high rainfall area,extreme temperature swings].

My experience level as a buyer is [EXPERIENCE:select:first-time buyer,have purchased before,experienced investor,real estate professional]. My primary concern areas include [CONCERNS?], and my budget sensitivity for potential repairs is [BUDGET:select:very budget-conscious (major issues only),moderate (willing to negotiate repairs),flexible (mostly concerned with safety issues),investment mindset (calculating total cost)].

Please generate a comprehensive home inspection checklist organized by building system and area. For each category, identify the specific items to inspect given the property age and characteristics, highlight red flags that are particularly relevant for homes of this era, assign priority levels based on safety and cost implications, and note what questions I should ask the inspector about each area.

Cover these essential systems: structural and foundation elements with attention to settling and water intrusion, roofing and exterior including gutters and drainage, electrical systems and panel condition, plumbing including water heater and supply lines, HVAC heating and cooling equipment with ductwork, attic and insulation with ventilation assessment, basement or crawl space conditions, interior walls and ceilings for signs of issues, windows and doors for sealing and operation, kitchen and bathroom fixtures and ventilation, garage and any outbuildings, and landscaping drainage away from the foundation.

For a home of this age in this climate, identify the most likely problem areas I should pay special attention to, common issues that might not be immediately visible, estimated remaining lifespan of major systems, and any specialized inspections I should request beyond the standard assessment such as radon, sewer scope, or termite inspection.

Format the checklist so I can print it and use it during the walkthrough, with space to note findings and inspector comments for each item.
