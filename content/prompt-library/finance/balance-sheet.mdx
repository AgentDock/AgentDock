# Balance Sheet Template

Create a professional balance sheet for [BUSINESS_NAME], a [BUSINESS_TYPE:select:sole proprietorship,partnership,LLC,corporation,nonprofit,other business entity] operating in the [INDUSTRY] sector. The balance sheet date is [REPORTING_DATE] with all amounts reported in [CURRENCY:select:USD,EUR,GBP,CAD,AUD,JPY,CHF,CNY,INR,other currency].

The financial information to include is as follows. Assets consist of [ASSETS_DATA]. Liabilities consist of [LIABILITIES_DATA]. Equity includes [EQUITY_DATA].

Organize the balance sheet using standard accounting structure. Group current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses separately from non-current assets like property, plant, equipment, and intangible assets. Similarly, distinguish current liabilities payable within one year from long-term obligations. Within equity, present contributed capital, retained earnings, and any other equity components provided.

Calculate clear subtotals for each section including total current assets, total non-current assets, total assets, total current liabilities, total long-term liabilities, total liabilities, total equity, and total liabilities plus equity. Confirm that the fundamental accounting equation holds where total assets equals total liabilities plus equity. If a discrepancy exists, identify the imbalance amount and note where misclassification may have occurred.

Format the output as a properly structured balance sheet with aligned columns, clear section headings, and professional presentation suitable for financial reporting. Include a notes section at the end to explain any significant items, accounting policies applied, or notable observations about the financial position.
