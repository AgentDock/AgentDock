# Moving Checklist Generator

I am moving and need a complete checklist so I do not forget anything important.

I am moving in [TIMEFRAME:select:less than 2 weeks,2-4 weeks,1-2 months,more than 2 months].

The type of move is [MOVE_TYPE:select:local within the same city,within the same state,to a different state,international].

I am moving from [CURRENT_HOME:select:an apartment,a house,a room or shared housing] to [NEW_HOME:select:an apartment,a house,a room or shared housing].

My moving approach is [APPROACH:select:hiring full-service movers,hiring movers for heavy items only,renting a truck and DIY,using a portable container service,a combination].

Special considerations: [SPECIAL?] (such as pets, kids, home sale, lease breaking, elderly family members, etc.)

Create a complete moving timeline and checklist organized by weeks before the move. Include tasks for changing address and utilities, packing and decluttering, hiring movers or reserving trucks, handling lease or home sale logistics, packing essentials for moving day, setting up the new home, and post-move tasks I might forget. Mark items that need to be done by specific deadlines. Suggest what to pack last and unpack first. Include money-saving tips and things that commonly get forgotten.
