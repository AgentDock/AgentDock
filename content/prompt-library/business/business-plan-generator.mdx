Additional context about my background, existing resources, or constraints: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Generate a complete business plan with the following sections, tailored to convince my target audience:

1. Executive Summary - Lead with the opportunity. State the business concept in one compelling sentence, the problem being solved, the target market size, your unique advantage, funding request if applicable, and projected returns. This section alone should make the reader want to continue.

2. Company Description - Explain the business model, legal structure, mission statement, and founding story. Describe the vision for where this company will be in five years and why this team is uniquely positioned to achieve it.

3. Market Analysis - Present thorough research on the total addressable market, serviceable addressable market, and serviceable obtainable market. Identify target customer segments with demographic and psychographic details. Analyze market trends, growth projections, and timing factors that make this the right moment to enter.

4. Competitive Analysis - Map the competitive landscape with direct and indirect competitors. Create a positioning matrix showing how we differentiate on key factors. Identify our sustainable competitive advantages and barriers to entry we can build over time.

5. Products or Services - Describe the core offering in detail, including features, benefits, and pricing strategy. Outline the product roadmap and future expansion opportunities. Explain the value proposition from the customer's perspective.

6. Marketing and Sales Strategy - Define the go-to-market approach, customer acquisition channels, and sales process. Include customer acquisition cost estimates, conversion funnel assumptions, and retention strategies. Specify the marketing budget allocation across channels.

7. Operations Plan - Detail the day-to-day operations including location, equipment, technology stack, suppliers, and logistics. Describe quality control processes and key operational metrics to track. Outline the scaling plan as the business grows.

8. Management Team - Present the founding team with relevant experience and track record. Identify key hires needed and the timeline for building the organization. Include advisors, board members, or strategic partners if applicable.

9. Financial Projections - Provide three-year projections including revenue forecast by month for year one then quarterly for years two and three. Include startup costs, operating expenses, break-even analysis, and cash flow projections. State key assumptions clearly and conservatively.

10. Funding Request and Use of Funds - If seeking funding, specify the amount requested, preferred structure such as equity or debt, and exactly how funds will be allocated. Include milestones that funding will achieve and projected return on investment.

11. Risk Analysis and Mitigation - Identify the top five risks to this business including market, operational, financial, and competitive risks. For each risk, provide a specific mitigation strategy and contingency plan.

12. Appendix Items Needed - List supporting documents that should be prepared separately such as detailed financial models, market research data, letters of intent, resumes, and legal documents.

Format your response with clear section headers. Use bullet points for lists and tables where they improve clarity. Include specific numbers and percentages whenever making projections, clearly labeling assumptions. Write in a confident, professional tone that demonstrates domain expertise while remaining accessible to readers who may not be industry insiders.

For financial projections, provide realistic ranges rather than single-point estimates where uncertainty is high. Flag any areas where additional research or professional consultation such as legal or accounting review would strengthen the plan.

If any critical information is missing from my description that would significantly impact the quality of specific sections, note what additional details would be helpful but provide reasonable assumptions to complete the plan rather than leaving sections empty.
