# Essay Improver

I have written an essay and need feedback to make it stronger before I submit it.

Here is my essay: [ESSAY_TEXT]

This essay is for [CONTEXT:select:a high school class,a college or university course,a graduate program,a scholarship or application,a professional publication,personal or blog writing].

The essay type is [ESSAY_TYPE:select:argumentative or persuasive,analytical or critical,expository or informative,narrative or personal,compare and contrast,research paper].

I am most concerned about [MAIN_CONCERN:select:the overall argument and thesis,the structure and organization,the clarity and flow,the grammar and style,the introduction and conclusion,all of the above - give me a full review].

The assignment requirements or guidelines: [REQUIREMENTS?]

Review my essay and provide specific, actionable feedback. Evaluate the strength of my thesis and whether the essay consistently supports it. Identify paragraphs that are weak, unclear, or off-topic. Point out logical gaps or missing evidence. Suggest specific improvements for my introduction and conclusion. Flag any awkward sentences or unclear phrasing. Note grammar and style issues without rewriting the whole thing for me. Tell me what is working well so I keep those elements. Prioritize the feedback by what will have the biggest impact on my grade or effectiveness.
