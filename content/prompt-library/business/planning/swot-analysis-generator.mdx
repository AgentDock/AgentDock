# SWOT Analysis Generator

I need a SWOT analysis to understand my competitive position and inform my strategy.

The subject of this analysis is [SUBJECT] (your business, product, project, or idea).

My industry or market is [INDUSTRY].

My main competitors are [COMPETITORS?].

Current resources and capabilities: [RESOURCES]

Recent or upcoming changes in my market: [MARKET_CHANGES?]

The purpose of this analysis is [PURPOSE:select:strategic planning,launching a new product or service,entering a new market,evaluating my competitive position,preparing for investment or funding,general business review].

Create a comprehensive SWOT analysis with at least 5 points in each quadrant. For Strengths, focus on internal advantages and unique capabilities. For Weaknesses, identify internal limitations honestly. For Opportunities, look at external trends and market gaps I could exploit. For Threats, consider external risks and competitive pressures. Prioritize each list by importance. After the SWOT, suggest 3-5 strategic actions that leverage my strengths to capture opportunities or address weaknesses and threats. Be specific and actionable rather than generic.
