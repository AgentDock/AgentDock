# Rent vs Buy Calculator

I need help deciding whether to rent or buy a home based on my specific financial situation. Here are my details.

The home I am considering purchasing costs [HOME_PRICE:number:100000-5000000] dollars with a down payment of [DOWN_PAYMENT_PERCENT:number:3-100] percent. My expected mortgage interest rate is [MORTGAGE_RATE:number:1-15] percent on a [LOAN_TERM:select:15-year,20-year,30-year] mortgage. Annual property taxes in this area run approximately [PROPERTY_TAX_PERCENT:number:0.1-5] percent of home value, and homeowners insurance would cost around [INSURANCE_ANNUAL:number:500-10000] dollars per year. I expect to pay [MAINTENANCE_PERCENT:number:0.5-4] percent of home value annually for maintenance and repairs. [HOA_MONTHLY?] My HOA fees would be this amount per month if applicable.

For the rental comparison, my current or expected rent is [MONTHLY_RENT:number:500-10000] dollars per month. Rents in my area typically increase [RENT_INCREASE:number:0-10] percent annually. My renter's insurance costs approximately [RENTERS_INSURANCE:number:100-500] dollars per year.

Regarding my investment assumptions, if I did not buy a home, I would invest my down payment in assets that could reasonably earn [INVESTMENT_RETURN:number:1-15] percent annually. I expect home values in this market to appreciate at [HOME_APPRECIATION:number:-5-15] percent per year. My marginal tax bracket is [TAX_BRACKET:number:0-50] percent, and I [ITEMIZE_DEDUCTIONS:select:do,do not] plan to itemize deductions on my tax return.

I plan to stay in this location for approximately [YEARS_STAYING:number:1-30] years. My priorities for this decision include [PRIORITIES:select:pure financial optimization,building equity for the future,flexibility to relocate,stability and putting down roots,a combination of financial and lifestyle factors].

Please analyze both scenarios year by year for my planned time horizon. Calculate my total cost of renting including rent payments, rent increases over time, renter's insurance, and the opportunity cost of not building equity. Calculate my total cost of buying including mortgage payments broken into principal and interest, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA fees if applicable, closing costs estimated at 3 percent of home price, and eventual selling costs at 6 percent. Factor in the mortgage interest and property tax deductions if I itemize, and show how my equity builds over time versus how my down payment would have grown if invested instead.

Identify the breakeven point where buying becomes financially advantageous over renting, or confirm if renting remains better for my entire time horizon. Present the results in a clear comparison table showing cumulative costs for both options at years 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 or my full timeframe. Conclude with a specific recommendation based on my numbers and priorities, explaining the key factors that drive the decision in my particular situation.
