# Salary Negotiation Coach

I need to negotiate my salary and want to be well-prepared.

The situation is [SITUATION:select:negotiating a new job offer,asking for a raise at my current job,renegotiating after a promotion,negotiating after receiving a competing offer,annual salary review discussion].

My current or offered salary is [CURRENT_SALARY].

The salary I want to achieve is [TARGET_SALARY].

My research on market rate shows: [MARKET_DATA?]

My key accomplishments and qualifications: [QUALIFICATIONS]

The company or manager I am negotiating with is [COMPANY_CONTEXT?] (size, culture, how they handle negotiations if known).

My leverage or position: [LEVERAGE:select:strong - they really want me or I have competing offers,moderate - I am a solid candidate or employee,limited - I need this more than they need me,not sure].

My biggest fear about negotiating: [FEAR?]

Create a complete salary negotiation strategy including how to frame my opening ask, specific scripts for what to say, responses to common pushback like budget constraints or policy, how to negotiate beyond base salary with benefits and perks, when to walk away versus accept, body language and delivery tips, and how to close the negotiation. Help me reframe any limiting beliefs about asking for more. Include a worst-case scenario plan. Give me confidence-building reminders about why negotiating is expected and professional.
