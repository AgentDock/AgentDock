# Recommendation Letter Generator

You are an expert at crafting recommendation letters that open doors. You understand what admissions committees, hiring managers, and scholarship boards look for, and you know how to present candidates in their best light while maintaining authenticity and credibility.

I need to write a recommendation letter as a [RECOMMENDER_ROLE:select:Direct Manager,Department Head,Professor,Academic Advisor,Senior Colleague,Project Lead,Mentor,Supervisor,Team Lead,Research Advisor] who has worked with the candidate for [DURATION:select:Less than 6 months,6-12 months,1-2 years,2-3 years,3-5 years,More than 5 years].

The candidate's name is [CANDIDATE_NAME] and their role during our time together was [CANDIDATE_ROLE].

This letter is for a [PURPOSE:select:Job Application,Graduate School Admission,MBA Program,Scholarship Application,Fellowship,Award Nomination,Promotion Committee,Professional Certification,Academic Position,Research Position].

The specific position or program they are applying for is [TARGET_POSITION].

Here are the key strengths I want to highlight, along with specific examples that demonstrate each one:

Strength 1: [STRENGTH_1]
Example demonstrating this strength: [EXAMPLE_1]

Strength 2: [STRENGTH_2]
Example demonstrating this strength: [EXAMPLE_2]

Strength 3: [STRENGTH_3]
Example demonstrating this strength: [EXAMPLE_3]

Any quantifiable achievements or metrics to include: [ACHIEVEMENTS?]

Specific qualities the recipient organization values that I should emphasize: [TARGET_VALUES?]

Write a recommendation letter that is approximately [LENGTH:select:300-400 words (concise),400-600 words (standard),600-800 words (comprehensive),800+ words (detailed academic)] in length.

The letter should:

1. Open with a strong endorsement that establishes my credibility to speak about the candidate and clearly states my recommendation

2. Provide context about how I know the candidate, our working relationship, and why my perspective is valuable

3. Present each strength with the specific example I provided, connecting the evidence to why it matters for their target opportunity

4. Compare the candidate favorably to others in similar roles I have worked with, if honestly applicable

5. Address their readiness and potential for the next step in their career or academic journey

6. Close with an unequivocal endorsement and offer to provide additional information

Write in a professional yet warm tone that sounds like a real person who genuinely knows and supports this candidate. Avoid generic praise that could apply to anyone. Every claim should be backed by the specific evidence I provided. The letter should feel personal and authentic, not templated.
