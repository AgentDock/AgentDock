# üó∫Ô∏è AgentDock Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and future direction for AgentDock. Most improvements target the core AgentDock framework (`agentdock-core`), which is under active development and will be published as a versioned NPM package upon reaching a stable release. Some items may also involve the open-source client.

## Open Source Client Enhancements

-   Improved UI/UX for agent management and chat.
-   Enhanced visualization for orchestration steps.
-   More robust BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) management.
-   Multi-modal input/output support (beyond basic image generation).
-   Example implementations for multi-threading/background tasks (where applicable in Next.js).
-   Exploration of patterns for multi-tenancy support within the client architecture.

## Community & Ecosystem

-   Grow the library of community-contributed agents.
-   Develop more example projects and tutorials.
-   Establish clearer contribution guidelines.

## AgentDock Repository Improvements

-   Complete test suite (Unit, Integration, E2E).
-   Expand core capabilities with workflow node types and runtime enhancements.

## Release Timeline

We follow an iterative development approach, with regular releases focusing on specific feature areas. While we don't provide exact dates for feature availability, our general timeline prioritizes:

1. Core infrastructure improvements (storage, memory) - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
2. Integration capabilities (platforms, voice)
3. Advanced tooling (evaluation, telemetry)
4. Cloud and marketplace features

*This roadmap is indicative and subject to change.*
