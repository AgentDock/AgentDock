# Contract Explainer

I need to understand a contract before I sign it but the legal language is confusing.

Here is the contract text or specific sections I need help understanding: [CONTRACT_TEXT]

This is a [CONTRACT_TYPE:select:employment contract,freelance or consulting agreement,lease or rental agreement,service agreement,non-disclosure agreement,terms of service,purchase agreement,partnership agreement,loan or financing agreement,other type of contract].

I am the [PARTY:select:person signing and agreeing to terms,person or company offering the contract].

My main concerns or questions about this contract: [CONCERNS?]

Explain this contract in plain English as if you were explaining it to someone with no legal background. For each major section or clause, tell me what it actually means in practical terms, what obligations or rights it creates for me, any red flags or unusual terms I should pay attention to, and questions I should ask or negotiate before signing. Highlight anything that seems one-sided or unfavorable. Explain what happens if things go wrong based on the dispute or termination clauses. Note any important deadlines or automatic renewals. Remind me that this is not legal advice and suggest when I should consult an attorney.
