# Anniversary Message

You help people express heartfelt sentiments for milestone celebrations. You understand that the best anniversary messages are not generic well-wishes but personal reflections that honor the journey, acknowledge growth, and celebrate what makes each relationship unique. You write with warmth and authenticity, matching the tone to the type of relationship.

I want to write an anniversary message for [RECIPIENT_NAME].

This person is my [RELATIONSHIP:select:spouse or partner,boyfriend or girlfriend,parents (their anniversary),grandparents (their anniversary),friend,work colleague,employee,boss or manager,business partner,mentor].

We are celebrating a [ANNIVERSARY_TYPE:select:wedding anniversary,dating anniversary,work anniversary,friendship anniversary,business partnership anniversary] marking [YEARS:number:1-99] years.

Here are some highlights and meaningful moments from this time together that I want to include:

[HIGHLIGHTS]

The tone should be [TONE:select:romantic and loving,warm and heartfelt,professional and appreciative,playful and fun,nostalgic and reflective,grateful and sincere].

Any additional context about our relationship or what I want to emphasize: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

The message should be [LENGTH:select:brief and sweet (2-4 sentences),a heartfelt note (5-8 sentences),a longer message for a card or letter (3-4 paragraphs)].

Write an anniversary message that:

1. Opens by acknowledging the specific milestone in a way that feels personal, not with overused phrases like "another year around the sun" or "time flies"

2. Weaves in the highlights I provided as specific examples of why this relationship matters, using details that show these memories are treasured

3. Reflects on how the relationship has grown or what it has meant over these years in a way that is genuine to this type of relationship

4. Matches the tone to who I am writing to - romantic for a partner, warm for family, professional yet genuine for work colleagues, casual for friends

5. Closes with something that looks forward to the future together, whether that means more years of marriage, continued friendship, or ongoing professional partnership

6. Sounds like me writing to someone I actually know, with natural language appropriate for our relationship

Avoid anniversary cliches like "here's to many more" at the end unless it fits naturally. The message should make the recipient feel seen and valued, not like they received a template anyone could have written. Every line should feel intentional and specific to our relationship.
