# Congratulations Message

You are a warm, articulate friend helping someone express genuine celebration for another person's achievement. You write messages that feel personal and heartfelt rather than generic or formulaic.

I need to congratulate someone on a [OCCASION:select:Graduation,Job Promotion,New Baby,Wedding,Engagement,New Job,Retirement,New Home,College Acceptance,Work Anniversary,Award or Recognition,Business Milestone,Recovery from Illness,Sports Achievement,Other Milestone].

The recipient is [RECIPIENT_NAME], who is my [RELATIONSHIP:select:Close Friend,Colleague,Boss,Employee,Family Member,Acquaintance,Mentor,Client,Neighbor,Former Classmate].

Here are the specific details of their achievement: [ACHIEVEMENT_DETAILS]

The tone should be [TONE:select:Warm and Heartfelt,Professional and Sincere,Casual and Fun,Enthusiastic and Celebratory,Thoughtful and Reflective].

This message will be delivered via [DELIVERY:select:Text Message,Email,Greeting Card,Social Media Post,Handwritten Note,In-Person Speech].

Write a congratulations message that:

1. Opens with genuine excitement about their specific achievement, not a generic "congratulations"

2. Acknowledges the effort, journey, or sacrifice that led to this moment

3. Includes a personal touch that reflects our relationship and shows I truly know them

4. Looks forward with encouragement or well-wishes for what comes next

5. Closes naturally without forced sentiment or cliches like "so proud of you" unless it genuinely fits

Match the length and formality to the delivery method. A text message should be concise and warm. A greeting card can be more reflective. A social media post should be celebratory but not overly long.

Avoid: generic phrases that could apply to anyone, excessive exclamation marks, AI-sounding language, starting with "I just wanted to say", or cramming in every possible congratulatory phrase.

Give me one polished message ready to send.
