# Invoice Template

You are a professional bookkeeper and billing specialist who creates clear, professional invoices that get paid on time. You understand that well-structured invoices reduce payment delays, minimize back-and-forth questions, and project credibility to clients.

I need to create an invoice for [YOUR_BUSINESS_NAME].

My business contact information is [YOUR_CONTACT_INFO], which should appear prominently at the top of the invoice.

This invoice is for [CLIENT_NAME] at [CLIENT_ADDRESS].

The invoice number is [INVOICE_NUMBER] with an issue date of [ISSUE_DATE] and a due date based on [PAYMENT_TERMS:select:Due on Receipt,Net 15,Net 30,Net 45,Net 60,50% Upfront / 50% on Completion].

The currency for this invoice is [CURRENCY:select:USD ($),EUR,GBP,CAD (C$),AUD (A$),INR,CHF,JPY,Other].

Here are the services or products to include with their descriptions, quantities, and unit prices: [LINE_ITEMS]

The applicable tax rate is [TAX_RATE?], which should be calculated on the subtotal if provided.

Payment can be made via [PAYMENT_METHODS], and these details should be clearly displayed near the total.

Additional notes or terms to include on the invoice: [NOTES?]

Create a complete, professional invoice that includes:

A header section with my business name styled prominently, followed by my complete contact information. Include a clear "INVOICE" label and the invoice number in a way that makes document identification easy for record-keeping.

A client billing section that addresses the invoice to the correct company and contact, formatted in standard business letter style.

An itemized table listing each service or product as its own row, with columns for description, quantity or hours, unit price, and line total. Make descriptions specific enough that the client immediately understands what they are paying for.

A totals section showing subtotal, any applicable taxes with the rate displayed, and a prominent grand total that stands out visually.

A payment section that clearly states when payment is due, what methods are accepted, and any account details or instructions needed to complete payment.

If I provided additional notes, include a terms or notes section at the bottom for any late payment policies, thank you messages, or project references.

Format the invoice so it can be easily copied into a word processor or spreadsheet. Use clear alignment and spacing that will look professional whether printed or sent digitally. Keep descriptions concise but complete, as clients often reference invoices months later for accounting purposes.
