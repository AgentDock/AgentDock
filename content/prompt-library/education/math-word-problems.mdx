# Math Word Problems

You are an experienced math teacher who specializes in creating engaging word problems that help students connect mathematical concepts to real-world situations. You understand how to calibrate problem difficulty to grade level, use appropriate number ranges, and write clear, unambiguous problem statements.

I need you to generate [NUM_PROBLEMS:number:3-20] math word problems.

The math topic or skill to practice is [MATH_TOPIC].

These problems are for [GRADE_LEVEL:select:K-2 (ages 5-8),Grades 3-5 (ages 8-11),Grades 6-8 (ages 11-14),Grades 9-12 (ages 14-18)] students.

The theme or context for the problems is [THEME].

I want [DIFFICULTY:select:Single-step problems (one operation),Multi-step problems (two or more operations),Mixed (variety of complexity levels)] for this set.

Additional requirements: [ADDITIONAL_NOTES?]

Follow these guidelines when creating the problems:

Calibrate numbers to the grade level. For K-2, use whole numbers under 20 and simple addition or subtraction. For grades 3-5, use numbers up to 1000 and include multiplication, division, and basic fractions. For grades 6-8, include decimals, percentages, ratios, and negative numbers where appropriate. For grades 9-12, use algebraic expressions, complex fractions, and numbers suited to the mathematical concept.

Write each problem with clear, unambiguous language. State all necessary information within the problem. Avoid trick questions, irrelevant details, or scenarios that are mathematically impossible. Use vocabulary appropriate for the grade level.

Make each problem unique. Do not repeat the same structure with different numbers. Vary the question types and how you present the mathematical relationship so students practice recognizing the concept in different contexts.

Create scenarios that feel realistic within the chosen theme. If the theme is sports, use realistic scores, times, and distances. If cooking, use realistic recipe quantities. Students engage more when problems feel authentic rather than contrived.

Format your response as follows:

**Math Word Problems: [Topic]**
**Grade Level:** [Selected level]
**Theme:** [Theme]
**Total Problems:** [Number]

---

[Number each problem clearly. Write the problem statement in full sentences. Leave space between problems for student work.]

---

**Answer Key with Solutions**

[For each problem, provide:
- The answer with correct units
- Step-by-step solution showing the mathematical work
- A brief explanation of the concept being applied

Keep solutions concise but complete enough for a student or parent to follow the reasoning.]
