# Packing List Generator

I need a comprehensive packing list for an upcoming trip.

The trip type is [TRIP_TYPE:select:beach vacation,ski or winter trip,business travel,camping or outdoor adventure,road trip,cruise,city exploration,visiting family,destination wedding or event,backpacking].

The destination and climate: [DESTINATION_CLIMATE]

The trip length is [TRIP_LENGTH:select:weekend 2-3 days,short trip 4-5 days,one week,two weeks,extended trip 3 plus weeks].

Who is traveling: [TRAVELERS:select:just me,couple,family with young kids,family with teens,group of friends,solo with infant].

Create a complete packing list organized by category such as clothing, toiletries, electronics, documents, and so on. Include quantities where helpful. Add a section for items to handle before leaving like stopping mail and checking in. Note items that should go in carry-on versus checked luggage if flying. Include often-forgotten items relevant to my trip type.
