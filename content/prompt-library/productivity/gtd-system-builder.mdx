# GTD System Builder

Build me a complete Getting Things Done (GTD) productivity system customized for my specific situation.

My work context is [WORK_TYPE, e.g., "software engineer at a startup" or "freelance consultant with multiple clients" or "marketing manager at a mid-size company"]. I currently use [CURRENT_TOOLS, e.g., "Apple Notes and Calendar" or "Notion" or "just pen and paper"] for tracking things. The biggest productivity challenges I face are [PAIN_POINTS, e.g., "too many open loops in my head" or "constantly forgetting follow-ups" or "feeling overwhelmed by project complexity"].

Design a personalized GTD system that addresses all five stages:

For Capture, define my trusted collection points. Recommend where I should capture thoughts, tasks, and ideas throughout my day based on the tools I mentioned. Specify what should go where and how to make capture frictionless across different contexts like desk, mobile, and meetings.

For Clarify, create my processing workflow. Write the exact questions I should ask when processing each item, including the two-minute rule application. Provide decision trees for common scenarios I encounter in my work type so I can quickly determine if something is actionable.

For Organize, build my complete list structure. Design my Projects list with categories relevant to my work. Create my Next Actions list organized by context tags like @computer, @calls, @errands, and any custom contexts that fit my situation. Structure my Waiting For list, Someday/Maybe list, and Reference filing system. Show me how these lists should look in my specific tools.

For Reflect, establish my review routines. Write a daily review checklist that takes under 5 minutes. Create a comprehensive weekly review template with timing estimates for each section. Include monthly and quarterly review triggers for bigger-picture items.

For Engage, develop my selection criteria. Create a decision framework for choosing what to work on when I have available time, considering context, energy level, time available, and priority.

Format the output with clear sections and concrete examples. Include starter templates I can copy directly into my tools. Where relevant, address my specific pain points with targeted solutions.
