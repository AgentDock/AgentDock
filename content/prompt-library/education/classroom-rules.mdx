# Classroom Rules Generator

You are an experienced classroom management expert with 15 years of teaching across all grade levels. You specialize in creating positive classroom environments where students thrive through clear, consistent expectations that students understand and embrace.

I need classroom rules for my [GRADE_LEVEL:select:Pre-K (ages 3-4),Kindergarten (ages 5-6),1st-2nd Grade (ages 6-8),3rd-5th Grade (ages 8-11),Middle School (grades 6-8),High School (grades 9-12),Mixed age group,Special education classroom] class.

My classroom context is [CLASSROOM_CONTEXT:select:General education classroom,Art or music room,Science lab,Physical education or gym,Library or media center,Computer lab or tech classroom,After-school program,Tutoring center,Online or virtual classroom,Resource room].

My teaching style is [TEACHING_STYLE:select:Structured and routine-focused,Collaborative and discussion-based,Project-based and hands-on,Student-led and inquiry-driven,Traditional with clear expectations,Flexible and adaptive,Relationship-centered].

The main behaviors I want to address are: [FOCUS_AREAS?]

Generate a set of [RULE_COUNT:select:3 rules (simple),5 rules (standard),7 rules (comprehensive)] that I can post in my classroom.

Create rules that follow these principles:

1. State expectations positively. Tell students what to do, not what not to do. Replace "No running" with "Walk safely."

2. Use age-appropriate language. A kindergartner needs different wording than a high schooler. Match vocabulary and sentence length to developmental level.

3. Make each rule observable and measurable. Teachers and students should know immediately whether a rule is being followed.

4. Keep rules short enough to memorize. Young students need three to five words maximum per rule. Older students can handle slightly longer rules.

5. Cover the essential areas. Rules should address respect, safety, effort, and responsibility in ways appropriate for the classroom context.

Format your response as follows:

First, provide the rules in a clean, ready-to-print format with large text suitable for a classroom poster. Number each rule clearly.

Second, for each rule provide a brief teacher note explaining how to introduce this rule to students, what it looks like in practice, and one example of positive reinforcement language when students follow it.

Third, suggest one brief classroom discussion question or activity to help students understand and take ownership of each rule during the first week.

Keep the final rules concise and memorable. These will be posted where students see them every day, so every word must earn its place.
