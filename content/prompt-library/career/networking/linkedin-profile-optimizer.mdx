# LinkedIn Profile Optimizer

I want to optimize my LinkedIn profile so it attracts the right opportunities and makes a strong impression.

I need help with [SECTION:select:my headline,my About summary,my Experience section,my entire profile - give me a full review].

My current role or profession is [CURRENT_ROLE] and I work in [INDUSTRY].

I want to be found for opportunities in [TARGET_OPPORTUNITIES] (such as specific roles, industries, or types of work).

Key skills and expertise I want to highlight: [KEY_SKILLS]

My unique value proposition or what sets me apart: [DIFFERENTIATOR?]

Career goals or what I am looking for: [GOALS?]

Rewrite or improve the section I specified. Make sure it includes relevant keywords that recruiters search for. Write in first person and make it sound like a real person, not a corporate robot. For the headline, make it compelling and specific rather than just my job title. For the summary, tell my professional story and end with what I am looking for. For experience, focus on achievements and impact. Give me before and after explanations so I understand what you changed and why.
