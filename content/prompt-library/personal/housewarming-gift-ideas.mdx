Please suggest 5 thoughtful housewarming gift ideas tailored to this person. For each gift, tell me:

1. What the gift is and a brief description of why it works
2. How it matches their style and suits their new home
3. The approximate price range
4. Where to find it, whether online retailers or local store types

Focus on gifts that help make a new space feel like home, reflect genuine thought about the recipient, and go beyond generic options. Balance practical items they will actually use with special touches that add warmth and personality to their space.
