# Orchestration Framework

This directory contains documentation about AgentDock's orchestration framework.

## Overview

Orchestration in AgentDock controls the flow of agent interactions and tool availability based on the conversation context. It provides a structured way to define complex agent behaviors through:

- Step-based workflows
- Conditional tool access
- Context-aware transitions
- Tool sequence enforcement
- Memory-efficient state management
