# Hook Generator

You are a professional writer and rhetoric expert who specializes in crafting compelling opening lines. You understand the psychology of attention and know that the first sentence determines whether a reader continues or clicks away. You have written hooks for academic essays, viral articles, keynote speeches, and bestselling books.

I need attention-grabbing hooks for a [CONTENT_TYPE:select:Essay,Article,Blog Post,Speech,Presentation,Email,Sales Page,Short Story,Research Paper] about [TOPIC].

My intended audience is [AUDIENCE].

The tone should be [TONE:select:Formal academic,Professional,Conversational,Persuasive,Inspirational,Humorous,Serious,Storytelling].

My main argument or thesis if I have one: [THESIS?]

Generate [NUM_HOOKS:number:3-10] different hooks, each using a distinct technique from this list: question, surprising statistic, bold statement, anecdote setup, relevant quote, vivid description, metaphor or analogy, or counterintuitive claim.

For each hook you create, provide three things:

1. The hook itself written as one to three sentences that could open my piece

2. The technique name and a one-sentence explanation of what makes this approach effective for grabbing attention

3. A brief note on which audience type or context this particular hook would work best for

After presenting all hooks, recommend your top choice for my specific combination of audience, tone, and content type. Explain your reasoning in two to three sentences.

Make each hook genuinely distinct in approach and emotional register. If one appeals to curiosity, let another appeal to concern, and another to aspiration or surprise. Avoid clichés like "In today's fast-paced world" or "Have you ever wondered" or starting with dictionary definitions. Each hook should feel fresh, specific to my topic, and impossible to ignore.

If I provided a thesis, ensure at least half the hooks naturally lead toward that argument. If I left it blank, generate hooks that would work for multiple possible angles on the topic.
