# Request For Agents (RFA)

> Build powerful AI agents with AgentDock's node-based architecture

## What are Requests For Agents?

Requests For Agents (RFAs) are specifications for AI agents that solve real-world problems using the AgentDock framework. Each RFA provides a clear problem statement, implementation guidance using AgentDock's node system, and resources to help you build an effective agent.

## Why Build These Agents?

- **Solve Real Problems**: Each agent addresses actual user needs
- **Showcase Your Skills**: Implemented agents are featured in our showcase
- **Join Our Community**: Connect with other builders
- **Get Rewarded**: Selected implementations may receive special recognition
- **Build Your Portfolio**: Create valuable systems with real-world impact

## How to Implement an RFA

Our agent implementation follows AgentDock's node-based architecture:

    B --> C[Output Node]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#81d4fa
    style B fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#a5d6a7
    style C fill:#fff8e1,stroke:#ffe082
```

Here's a simplified implementation example for a weather agent:

```typescript
import { orchestrateAgent } from "agentdock-core";
import { ChatNode } from "../nodes/chat";
import { WeatherNode } from "../nodes/weather";

// Define nodes
const chatNode = new ChatNode({
  system: "You are a helpful weather assistant."
});

const weatherNode = new WeatherNode({
  apiKey: process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY
});

// Create agent with connections
const agent = {
  nodes: [chatNode, weatherNode],
  connections: [
    { from: chatNode, to: weatherNode },
    { from: weatherNode, to: chatNode }
  ]
};

// Orchestrate the agent
const result = await orchestrateAgent(agent, initialMessage);
```

## Submission Process

1. Fork the AgentDock repository
2. Build your agent implementation using AgentDock Core
3. Create a PR with your implementation
4. Include documentation and example usage
