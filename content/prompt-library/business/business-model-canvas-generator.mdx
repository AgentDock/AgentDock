# Business Model Canvas Generator

You are a seasoned business strategist and startup advisor who has helped hundreds of founders develop and refine their business models. You specialize in the Business Model Canvas framework developed by Alexander Osterwalder and have deep expertise in connecting all 9 blocks into a coherent, actionable strategy.

I am working on [BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION] and need you to generate a complete Business Model Canvas for this venture.

My business is at the [STAGE:select:Idea stage - still validating the concept,Early stage - building MVP or first customers,Growth stage - scaling what works,Mature stage - optimizing existing model] and operates in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology/SaaS,E-commerce/Retail,Healthcare/Wellness,Education/EdTech,Financial Services,Food and Beverage,Professional Services,Manufacturing,Media/Entertainment,Real Estate,Transportation/Logistics,Other] space.

Here is what I already know about my target customers and market: [EXISTING_MARKET_KNOWLEDGE?]

I want the canvas at [DETAIL_LEVEL:select:Executive summary - key points only,Standard - balanced depth for planning,Comprehensive - detailed analysis for investor discussions] level of detail.

Generate a complete Business Model Canvas with these 9 blocks:

1. Customer Segments - Identify the distinct groups of people or organizations this business aims to serve. Be specific about demographics, behaviors, needs, and why they would care about this solution.

2. Value Propositions - Articulate the bundle of products and services that create value for each customer segment. Explain what problem gets solved, what need gets satisfied, and why customers would choose this over alternatives.

3. Channels - Map out how the business reaches, communicates with, and delivers value to each customer segment. Cover awareness, evaluation, purchase, delivery, and post-purchase phases.

4. Customer Relationships - Define the type of relationship established with each customer segment. Consider personal assistance, self-service, automated services, communities, and co-creation.

5. Revenue Streams - Identify how the business generates cash from each customer segment. Specify pricing mechanisms, willingness to pay, and revenue model types.

6. Key Resources - List the most important assets required to make this business model work. Include physical, intellectual, human, and financial resources.

7. Key Activities - Describe the most important things the business must do to make the model work. Cover production, problem-solving, and platform/network activities.

8. Key Partnerships - Identify the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work. Explain the motivation for each partnership.

9. Cost Structure - Map out all costs incurred to operate this business model. Distinguish between fixed and variable costs, and identify the most important cost drivers.

For each block, provide:
- Three to five specific, actionable points tailored to this exact business
- Connections to other blocks where relevant
- One key assumption that should be validated
- One question for further exploration

After completing all 9 blocks, provide a brief synthesis that highlights:
- The strongest elements of this business model
- The riskiest assumptions that need validation
- Suggested next steps for iteration

Format each block with a clear heading, bullet points for the content, and italic text for assumptions and questions. Make every point specific to my business, not generic advice that could apply to any company.
