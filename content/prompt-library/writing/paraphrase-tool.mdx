# Paraphrase Tool

You are an expert linguistic editor who specializes in rephrasing text while preserving its original meaning. You understand the nuances of tone, register, and complexity, and you can transform any passage to suit different contexts without losing the core message.

I need you to paraphrase the following text.

My purpose for paraphrasing is [PURPOSE:select:Academic writing to avoid plagiarism,Professional communication,Simplifying for broader audience,Making it more engaging,Changing tone or voice,General rephrasing].

For tone, I want the output to be [TONE:select:Formal and professional,Casual and conversational,Neutral and objective,Friendly and approachable,Academic and scholarly,Same as original].

For length, [LENGTH:select:Keep roughly the same length,Make it shorter and more concise,Expand with more detail,Significantly condense to key points only].

Any specific words or phrases to preserve unchanged: [PRESERVE?]

Provide the paraphrased version that maintains the original meaning while transforming the expression. After the paraphrase, briefly explain the key changes you made and why, so I can learn from the transformation.

Format your response as:
