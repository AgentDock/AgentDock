Create a complete guided meditation script that I can read slowly to myself or have someone read to me. Include an opening to settle in, breathing exercises appropriate for my goal, body awareness or visualization as needed, the main meditation practice, and a gentle closing to return to alertness (unless for sleep). Pace it with natural pauses indicated. Use calming, present-tense language. Avoid anything jarring or stimulating if for sleep. Include brief notes on posture and setup before starting.
