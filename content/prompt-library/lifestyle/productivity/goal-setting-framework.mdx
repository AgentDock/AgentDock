# Goal Setting Framework

I have something I want to achieve but need help turning it into a clear, actionable goal.

The goal or aspiration I have is [GOAL_ASPIRATION].

The category is [CATEGORY:select:career or professional,health or fitness,financial,learning or education,relationship,creative,personal development,business or entrepreneurship,other].

My timeline is [TIMELINE:select:1 month,3 months,6 months,1 year,longer term vision].

Why this goal matters to me: [WHY_IT_MATTERS]

What I have tried before with similar goals: [PAST_ATTEMPTS?]

Resources and support available to me: [RESOURCES?]

Potential obstacles I anticipate: [OBSTACLES?]

Help me transform this into a clear, achievable goal. Make it specific, measurable, and time-bound. Break it into milestones at regular intervals. For each milestone, identify the key actions needed. Create a simple tracking system I will actually use. Build in accountability mechanisms. Address the obstacles I mentioned with specific strategies. Identify lead indicators that show I am on track before results appear. Include rewards and celebration points. Set a realistic expectation for progress while keeping it challenging. Help me prepare mentally for setbacks and how to recover.
