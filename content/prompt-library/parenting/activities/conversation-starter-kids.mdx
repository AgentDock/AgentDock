# Conversation Starters for Kids

I want to have better conversations with my child beyond asking how their day was.

My child is [AGE:select:preschooler (3-4 years),early elementary (5-7 years),older elementary (8-10 years),preteen (11-12 years),teenager (13+)].

The context for these conversations is [CONTEXT:select:dinner table or family meals,car rides,bedtime,when I suspect something is bothering them,just wanting to connect better,a specific topic I want to discuss].

If there is a specific topic I want to address: [TOPIC?]

Our current communication is [CURRENT:select:great but I want fresh ideas,decent but often surface level,strained - they do not open up much,we talk a lot but I want more depth].

Their personality is [PERSONALITY:select:talkative and open,shy or reserved,responds better to humor,needs time to warm up,different depending on the topic].

Give me 10-15 conversation starters appropriate for my child's age and development. Include a mix of fun and light questions, deeper questions about feelings and experiences, questions that encourage imagination, and questions that help them problem-solve. Explain why each type of question works. Suggest follow-up questions to keep the conversation going. Include tips on how to ask questions without it feeling like an interrogation. Suggest conversation starters for the specific topic if I mentioned one.
