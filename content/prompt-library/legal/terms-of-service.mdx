# Terms of Service Generator

You are a legal document specialist with extensive experience drafting Terms of Service agreements for technology companies, startups, and digital businesses. You understand the nuances of different service types and jurisdictional requirements, and you create documents that are comprehensive yet readable for non-lawyers.

I need you to create a Terms of Service document for my [SERVICE_TYPE:select:website,saas-platform,mobile-app,marketplace,subscription-service,freemium-app].

My company name is [COMPANY_NAME] and my service can be described as follows: [SERVICE_DESCRIPTION].

My primary jurisdiction and governing law should be [JURISDICTION:select:United States - Delaware,United States - California,United States - New York,European Union,United Kingdom,Canada,Australia,Singapore,International]. My users are subject to these restrictions: [USER_RESTRICTIONS].

Payment and billing information if applicable: [PAYMENT_TERMS?]

Types of data my service collects if relevant: [DATA_COLLECTION?]

My service allows user-generated content described as: [USER_GENERATED_CONTENT?]

Third-party services and integrations I use include: [THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATIONS?]

The contact email for legal inquiries is [CONTACT_EMAIL].

Create a complete Terms of Service document that includes the following sections, adapting each section appropriately for my service type and jurisdiction.

Begin with a brief non-legal-advice disclaimer stating this document was AI-generated and should be reviewed by a qualified attorney before use.

Include an Acceptance of Terms section explaining how users agree to be bound by these terms through their use of the service, with the effective date and how amendments will be communicated.

Add an Eligibility and Account Requirements section covering age requirements, account creation obligations, responsibility for account security, and any geographic restrictions on service availability.

For services with payments, include a Billing, Subscription, and Refunds section detailing payment terms, billing cycles, automatic renewal terms, how to cancel, and your refund policy.

Include a License Grant and Permitted Use section explaining what rights users receive to access and use the service, making clear this is a license and not ownership transfer.

Add an Acceptable Use Policy section listing prohibited activities including illegal use, abuse, circumvention of security measures, interference with other users, scraping or automated access without permission, and any service-specific restrictions.

If my service involves user content, include a User Content and Intellectual Property section explaining who owns user-submitted content, what license users grant you to display and use their content, your right to remove content, and DMCA or equivalent takedown procedures.

Include your Intellectual Property Rights section protecting your trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and proprietary technology.

Add a Third-Party Services and Links section disclaiming responsibility for third-party websites, services, or content, and explaining how third-party terms may apply.

Include a Privacy section referencing your Privacy Policy and explaining how user data is handled, with specific callouts for GDPR compliance if serving EU users or CCPA compliance if serving California residents.

Add a Disclaimers section with appropriate warranty disclaimers including as-is and as-available language, disclaimer of fitness for particular purpose, and disclaimer of uninterrupted or error-free service.

Include a Limitation of Liability section capping liability appropriately for your jurisdiction, excluding consequential damages, and setting a maximum aggregate liability amount.

Add an Indemnification section explaining what users agree to defend and hold you harmless against.

Include a Termination section explaining how either party can end the relationship, what happens to user data upon termination, and which provisions survive termination.

Add a Dispute Resolution section including your chosen method of resolution such as arbitration or litigation, class action waiver if appropriate for your jurisdiction, and small claims court exceptions.

Include a Governing Law and Jurisdiction section specifying which laws govern the agreement and where disputes must be resolved.

Add a Severability clause, an Entire Agreement clause, and an Assignment clause under General Provisions.

End with a Contact Information section providing your legal department email and physical mailing address if applicable.

Format the document with clear headings and subheadings. Use numbered sections for easy reference. Write in plain language that non-lawyers can understand while maintaining legal precision. Keep paragraphs short and scannable. The document should be comprehensive for my service type without unnecessary sections that do not apply.
