# Personal Workout Plan Generator

I want a personalized workout plan that fits my real life and that I will actually stick to.

My current fitness level is [FITNESS_LEVEL:select:complete beginner - new to exercise,beginner - some experience but inconsistent,intermediate - exercise regularly,advanced - very active and experienced].

My primary fitness goal is [PRIMARY_GOAL:select:lose weight and burn fat,build muscle and strength,improve overall fitness and health,increase flexibility and mobility,train for a specific sport or event,reduce stress and improve mental health].

The equipment I have access to is [EQUIPMENT:select:none - bodyweight exercises only,basic home equipment like dumbbells or resistance bands,a home gym with weights and a bench,full gym membership with all equipment].

I can dedicate [TIME_PER_SESSION:select:15-20 minutes per workout,30 minutes per workout,45-60 minutes per workout,over an hour per workout] and I am able to work out [DAYS_PER_WEEK:select:2-3 days per week,4 days per week,5-6 days per week,every day].

Any physical limitations or injuries I need to work around: [LIMITATIONS?]

Exercise types I enjoy or want to include: [PREFERENCES?]

Create a complete weekly workout plan for me. For each day, list the specific exercises with sets, reps, and rest periods. Include a brief warmup and cooldown for each session. Keep exercise descriptions short but clear enough that I know what to do. Make the plan progressive so I can build on it over time. If my goals or time are unrealistic, tell me honestly and suggest adjustments.
