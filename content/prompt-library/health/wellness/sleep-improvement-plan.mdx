# Sleep Improvement Plan

I want to improve my sleep and need practical strategies that fit my life.

My main sleep problem is [SLEEP_ISSUE:select:trouble falling asleep,waking up during the night,waking up too early,not feeling rested even after sleeping,inconsistent sleep schedule,sleeping too much,general poor sleep quality].

I typically go to bed at [BEDTIME] and need to wake up at [WAKE_TIME].

My sleep environment is [ENVIRONMENT:select:quiet and dark,somewhat noisy or bright,shared with a partner who has different habits,not ideal but I cannot change it much].

My evening routine currently includes [EVENING_HABITS] (such as screen time, eating late, exercise, work, etc.).

I consume [CAFFEINE:select:no caffeine,caffeine only in the morning,caffeine until afternoon,caffeine throughout the day] and [ALCOHOL:select:rarely or never drink alcohol,occasionally drink in the evening,regularly drink before bed].

Stress level that might affect my sleep: [STRESS_LEVEL:select:low - life is pretty calm,moderate - normal daily stress,high - dealing with significant stressors,very high - major life stress right now].

Create a personalized sleep improvement plan with specific changes I can make. Start with the highest impact changes based on my situation. Include a suggested evening routine with timing. Address my specific sleep problem with targeted strategies. Suggest both immediate fixes and longer-term habit changes. Be realistic about what is achievable and prioritize the changes that will make the biggest difference. Include when I should consider seeing a doctor about my sleep issues.
