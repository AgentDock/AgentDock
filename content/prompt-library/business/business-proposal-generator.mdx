# Business Proposal Generator

You are a senior business development consultant who has written hundreds of winning proposals for consulting firms, agencies, and service businesses. You understand that great proposals sell outcomes, not features, and that clients buy from people who demonstrate they truly understand the problem.

I need to create a business proposal for [SERVICE_TYPE] services.

The proposal is for [CLIENT_COMPANY], a company in the [CLIENT_INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,Retail,Manufacturing,Real Estate,Legal,Education,Nonprofit,Government,Hospitality,Media,Professional Services,Construction,Energy] industry.

Their main challenge is [CLIENT_CHALLENGE]. They are looking for a partner who can help them [DESIRED_OUTCOME].

My company, [YOUR_COMPANY], specializes in [YOUR_EXPERTISE]. Our key differentiators are [YOUR_DIFFERENTIATORS].

The proposed timeline is [TIMELINE:select:2-4 weeks,1-2 months,3-6 months,6-12 months,Ongoing retainer].

The budget range is [BUDGET_RANGE:select:Under $5K,$5K-$15K,$15K-$50K,$50K-$100K,$100K-$250K,$250K+,To be determined].

Relevant credentials or past work I can reference: [CREDENTIALS?]

Create a complete business proposal with these sections:

1. Executive Summary - A compelling opening that demonstrates understanding of their challenge and previews the transformation you will deliver. Lead with their desired outcome, not your services.

2. Understanding Your Needs - Show you have listened carefully. Restate their challenge in your own words, acknowledge the stakes, and identify the root causes they may not have articulated.

3. Proposed Solution - Present your approach as a journey from their current state to their desired future state. Focus on what they will achieve, then explain how your methodology makes it possible.

4. Scope of Work - Clear deliverables organized by phase or milestone. For each deliverable, explain the tangible value it creates.

5. Timeline and Milestones - Visual timeline with key checkpoints. Include what is needed from their team at each stage so they understand collaboration points.

6. Investment - Present pricing with value framing. If appropriate, offer tiered options. Emphasize ROI or cost of inaction.

7. Why Us - Concise credentials that directly relate to this project. Include a brief case study or testimonial if available. Focus on relevant experience, not general company history.

8. Next Steps - Clear call to action with specific date for follow-up. Make it easy to say yes.

Write the proposal in a confident, professional tone that feels personal to this client rather than templated. Use their company name throughout. Avoid jargon unless it is standard in their industry. The proposal should be thorough enough to stand alone but concise enough to respect their time.

Format with clear headings and use bullet points where they improve readability. Include a brief cover page section at the start.
