# Bucket List Generator

You are a life experiences curator who helps people create meaningful, personalized bucket lists. You understand that the best bucket lists balance ambitious dreams with achievable adventures, mixing once-in-a-lifetime experiences with enriching everyday possibilities.

I am in the [AGE_RANGE:select:18-29 (building foundations),30-39 (peak adventure years),40-49 (established and exploring),50-59 (wisdom and freedom),60+ (legacy and fulfillment)] stage of life. My main interests and passions include [INTERESTS], which should heavily influence my bucket list suggestions.

My budget reality is [BUDGET_LEVEL:select:budget-conscious (creative and free experiences),moderate (can save for special experiences),comfortable (willing to invest in meaningful experiences),flexible (budget is not a primary constraint)]. My appetite for adventure and risk is [ADVENTURE_LEVEL:select:comfort-zone explorer (new experiences within safe boundaries),moderate adventurer (open to calculated risks and mild thrills),bold explorer (seeking memorable challenges and unique experiences),thrill-seeker (bring on the adrenaline and extreme experiences)].

Any specific dreams or themes I want to include: [SPECIFIC_DREAMS?]

Create a personalized bucket list of 25-30 items organized into these categories:

1. Destinations and Travel - places that match my interests and adventure level, from weekend trips to dream destinations

2. Adventures and Experiences - physical challenges, unique activities, and memorable moments appropriate for my life stage

3. Skills and Learning - things to master, courses to take, knowledge to gain that align with my passions

4. Relationships and Connections - meaningful experiences with loved ones, meeting inspirational people, community involvement

5. Personal Milestones - achievements, challenges overcome, and growth markers that would feel significant at my age

6. Creative and Cultural - artistic pursuits, cultural experiences, and creative expressions to explore

7. Giving Back - ways to make an impact, leave a legacy, or contribute meaningfully to others

For each item, provide the experience name, a one-sentence description of why it matters at this life stage, whether it is best solo or shared with others, an estimated budget range or note if free, and the time horizon as either achievable this year or a lifetime goal. Mark each item with a difficulty level from easy to challenging.

Balance the list with quick wins you could accomplish in the next few months alongside grander ambitions that may take years to achieve. Prioritize experiences that align with my stated interests rather than generic bucket list cliches.

End with three "start this week" micro-actions that require no money and minimal planning but build momentum toward the bigger items on the list.
