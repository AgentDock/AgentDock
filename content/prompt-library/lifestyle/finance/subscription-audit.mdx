# Subscription Audit Master

I want to audit all my subscriptions and recurring charges to cut unnecessary expenses.

Here are the subscriptions and recurring charges I know about: [KNOWN_SUBSCRIPTIONS] (list service name and monthly cost)

Services I use frequently and want to keep: [MUST_KEEP?]

Services I rarely use but have not canceled: [RARELY_USE?]

My monthly budget for subscriptions ideally would be [IDEAL_BUDGET:select:under $50,50-100,100-150,150-200,no specific limit].

Categories of subscriptions I have: [CATEGORIES:select:streaming video,streaming music,software and apps,news and magazines,fitness and health,food delivery,gaming,cloud storage,professional tools,multiple categories].

Help me audit these subscriptions by calculating my total monthly and yearly subscription spending, identifying subscriptions I should consider canceling, finding duplicate services that overlap, suggesting cheaper alternatives for services I want to keep, creating a cancellation priority list, and providing tips for avoiding subscription creep in the future. Also suggest questions I should ask myself about each subscription to decide if it is worth keeping.
