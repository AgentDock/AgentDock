# Expense Auditor

I want to audit my expenses to find places where I can cut back and save money.

My monthly take-home income is [MONTHLY_INCOME].

Here are my recent monthly expenses by category: [EXPENSE_LIST] (list category and approximate monthly amount for housing, utilities, food, transportation, subscriptions, entertainment, etc.)

Or paste a summary from your bank or budgeting app: [BANK_SUMMARY?]

My current financial priorities: [PRIORITIES:select:build savings,pay off debt,reduce lifestyle creep,prepare for a big expense,just curious where money goes,need to cut spending urgently].

Expenses I am unwilling to cut: [NON_NEGOTIABLES?]

Analyze my spending and identify expenses that seem high compared to typical benchmarks, categories where I might be overspending, subscriptions or recurring charges I might have forgotten about, opportunities to negotiate or find better rates, small daily expenses that add up significantly, and specific recommendations for reducing spending in each category. Prioritize the changes that would make the biggest impact with the least lifestyle sacrifice. Calculate how much I could save with each recommendation.
