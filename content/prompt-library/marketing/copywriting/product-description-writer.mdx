# Product Description Writer

I need a product description that sells without sounding pushy or generic.

The product is [PRODUCT_NAME] and it is a [PRODUCT_TYPE].

The main features and specifications are: [FEATURES]

The key benefits and problems it solves for customers: [BENEFITS]

My target customer is [TARGET_CUSTOMER] and they care most about [CUSTOMER_PRIORITIES] (such as quality, price, convenience, status, sustainability, etc.).

This product is different from competitors because [DIFFERENTIATOR].

The brand voice is [BRAND_VOICE:select:professional and premium,friendly and approachable,fun and playful,minimalist and modern,rugged and authentic,luxurious and sophisticated].

The description will be used for [PLATFORM:select:my own website,Amazon or online marketplace,social media,print catalog,multiple platforms].

Write a product description that leads with benefits rather than just listing features. Use sensory and emotional language that helps customers imagine using the product. Include social proof elements like common use cases. Address likely objections or questions. Optimize for scanning with short paragraphs and bullet points for key features. Keep it the appropriate length for the platform. Include a subtle call to action. Make every word earn its place.
