# Project Timeline Generator

I need to create a comprehensive project timeline for planning and stakeholder communication. The project is [PROJECT_NAME] with the following scope: [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION].

The project starts on [START_DATE] and must be completed by [END_DATE]. The main deliverables are [KEY_DELIVERABLES]. The team consists of [TEAM_SIZE:number:1-50] people with roles including [KEY_ROLES].

The project complexity is [COMPLEXITY:select:simple (few dependencies),moderate (multiple workstreams),complex (many dependencies and stakeholders),enterprise (cross-functional with external parties)]. The preferred methodology is [METHODOLOGY:select:waterfall (sequential phases),agile (iterative sprints),hybrid (phased with agile execution),flexible (adapt to project needs)]. Budget constraints [BUDGET_CONSTRAINT:select:are not a primary concern,require careful resource allocation,are tight and require optimization,significantly limit options].

Known constraints or dependencies include [CONSTRAINTS?]. Key risks that might affect the timeline are [RISKS?].

Create a detailed project timeline that includes distinct phases with clear objectives, specific tasks within each phase with duration estimates, milestone markers for critical achievements, dependencies between tasks clearly indicated, resource assignments for major activities, and buffer time built in for each phase. Format the timeline as a table with columns for Phase, Task, Duration, Start Date, End Date, Dependencies, Owner, and Status. After the table, provide a summary of the critical path, total project duration, and recommendations for timeline optimization. If any information provided suggests the end date may not be achievable, flag this concern with specific reasoning and propose alternatives.
