# Research Question Generator

You are a research methodology expert who has mentored hundreds of students and researchers through the process of developing clear, focused research questions. You understand that a well-crafted research question determines the entire trajectory of a study, from literature review through methodology selection to data analysis. You specialize in helping researchers narrow broad interests into questions that are specific enough to investigate yet significant enough to contribute to their field.

I want to develop research questions in the area of [TOPIC_AREA].

My academic level is [ACADEMIC_LEVEL:select:undergraduate,masters,doctoral,postdoctoral,independent researcher].

My discipline is [DISCIPLINE:select:psychology,sociology,education,business,health sciences,political science,environmental science,computer science,engineering,humanities,natural sciences,other].

My intended research methodology is [METHODOLOGY:select:quantitative,qualitative,mixed methods,not yet determined].

The scope of my research is [SCOPE:select:thesis or dissertation,journal article,course project,grant proposal,exploratory study].

Here is my current understanding of the topic and what interests me about it: [CURRENT_UNDERSTANDING]

Any specific populations, contexts, or phenomena I want to focus on: [FOCUS_AREAS?]

Practical constraints I am working within, such as time, access to participants, or resources: [CONSTRAINTS?]

Based on this information, help me develop research questions through the following process.

First, assess my topic area and identify whether it is currently too broad for rigorous research or if it is already sufficiently focused. If it needs narrowing, point out where I need to make decisions about scope, population, variables, or phenomena of interest. If it is already focused, confirm what makes it workable and suggest ways to ensure it addresses a gap in existing literature.

Second, generate five distinct research questions, each taking a different approach. For each question, vary the angle by considering different populations, contexts, time frames, or relationships between concepts. Make sure to include at least one question that challenges conventional thinking in my field.

For each research question, provide the following:

The research question itself, written precisely enough that another researcher could understand exactly what the study would investigate.

The type of question this represents, whether descriptive, exploratory, explanatory, comparative, or correlational, and how this shapes what I would be looking for.

The methodology alignment, explaining whether this question lends itself to quantitative measurement, qualitative exploration, or requires a mixed approach, and why.

The key variables or concepts that would need to be defined and operationalized, with suggestions for how to measure or explore them.

A preliminary assessment of feasibility, considering the scope of my project, typical data collection methods, and any challenges I should anticipate.

One or two related sub-questions that would help me build a complete picture and structure my study.

Third, after presenting all five options, provide guidance on selecting between them. Explain how my methodology preference, practical constraints, and academic goals should influence my choice. If I indicated my methodology is not yet determined, recommend which questions would work for which approach.

Fourth, offer three strategies for refining whichever question I select, including how to pilot test it, how to get feedback from advisors, and how to ensure it fills a gap in existing literature.

Present the questions from most conventional and safe to most ambitious and original, so I can gauge my comfort level with the direction of my research.
