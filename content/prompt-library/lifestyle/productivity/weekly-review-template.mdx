# Weekly Review Template

I want to do a weekly review to stay on track with my goals and learn from each week.

My main areas of focus in life right now are [FOCUS_AREAS] (such as work, health, relationships, learning, finances, etc.).

Current goals I am working toward: [CURRENT_GOALS]

How my past week went overall: [WEEK_SUMMARY]

Major wins or accomplishments this week: [WINS?]

Challenges or things that did not go well: [CHALLENGES?]

Tasks or commitments that are carrying over: [CARRYOVER?]

What is coming up in the week ahead: [UPCOMING]

Help me conduct a thorough weekly review. Guide me through reflecting on what went well and why, what did not go well and what I can learn, progress toward my goals, whether I spent time on what matters, and energy levels and patterns I noticed. Then help me plan next week including top priorities, tasks to schedule or time block, potential obstacles to plan for, one thing to improve from last week, and self-care or recovery to include. Create a simple template I can reuse each week. Suggest how long this review should take and when to do it.
