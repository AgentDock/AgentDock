# Small Talk Helper

I struggle with small talk and need help knowing what to say in social situations.

The situation I am preparing for is [SITUATION:select:networking event,office party or work event,meeting partner's friends or family,neighborhood or community event,wedding or formal gathering,casual party,waiting room or shared space,travel like plane or train].

My relationship to the people is [RELATIONSHIP:select:complete strangers,people I will see again professionally,acquaintances I barely know,friends of friends,new coworkers,potential clients or contacts].

My biggest challenge with small talk is [CHALLENGE:select:starting conversations,keeping conversations going,avoiding awkward silences,knowing when or how to exit,not knowing what topics are appropriate,feeling fake or inauthentic,anxiety in social situations].

My personality in social settings is [PERSONALITY:select:naturally introverted,extroverted but sometimes awkward,depends on my comfort level,generally anxious,confident but want to improve].

Topics I am comfortable discussing: [COMFORTABLE_TOPICS?]

Give me a toolkit for small talk in this situation including conversation starters that feel natural, follow-up questions to deepen surface conversations, graceful ways to exit conversations, topics that are generally safe and interesting, topics to avoid, body language tips, and how to handle awkward moments. Make the suggestions feel authentic rather than scripted. Include specific phrases I can use. Address my specific challenge with targeted strategies. Remind me that small talk is a skill that improves with practice.
