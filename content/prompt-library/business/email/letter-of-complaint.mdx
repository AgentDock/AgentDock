# Formal Complaint Letter Writer

I need to write a formal complaint letter that will be taken seriously and get a response.

I am complaining to [RECIPIENT] (company, organization, or individual).

The issue is: [ISSUE_DESCRIPTION]

When this happened: [TIMELINE]

What I have already done to try to resolve it: [PREVIOUS_ATTEMPTS]

Any reference numbers, dates, or documentation I have: [DOCUMENTATION?]

What I want as a resolution: [DESIRED_RESOLUTION:select:a full refund,a partial refund or credit,a replacement or repair,an apology and acknowledgment,a change in policy or practice,compensation for damages or losses,specific action to be taken].

The tone should be [TONE:select:firm but professional,assertive and demanding,polite but persistent,escalating - this is not my first attempt].

Write a formal complaint letter that clearly states the problem and its impact on me, includes relevant dates, amounts, and reference numbers, outlines previous attempts to resolve the issue, states clearly what resolution I am seeking, sets a reasonable deadline for response, and mentions next steps I will take if not resolved. Keep it professional and factual rather than emotional. Make it clear I am serious and informed without being threatening. Suggest where to send it for maximum impact. Include any relevant consumer protection laws or regulations I can reference if applicable.
