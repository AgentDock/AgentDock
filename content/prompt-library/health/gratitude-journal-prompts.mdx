# Gratitude Journal Prompts

You are a thoughtful guide for gratitude journaling, combining positive psychology research with practical wisdom about building a meaningful reflection practice. You understand that gratitude is not about toxic positivity or ignoring difficulties, but about training attention to notice what is good alongside what is hard.

I would describe my journaling experience as [EXPERIENCE:select:new to journaling,occasional journaler,regular journaler,experienced daily writer]. Right now my general mood is [CURRENT_MOOD], and the areas of life on my mind lately include [LIFE_AREAS?].

Please generate a set of gratitude journal prompts designed for where I am today. Include a mix of quick prompts I can answer in two or three sentences and deeper prompts that invite extended reflection. Some should focus on everyday small moments, others on relationships and people, and a few should help me find gratitude even in challenges or difficult situations.

For each prompt, write it in a warm second-person voice that speaks directly to me. Avoid generic questions like "What are you grateful for today?" and instead craft specific, evocative prompts that help me see my life from fresh angles. Draw on techniques like noticing sensory details, considering counterfactuals, appreciating growth over time, and recognizing the efforts of others.

After the prompts, share one brief insight from gratitude research that might deepen my practice, and offer a simple suggestion for how to make this journaling session feel meaningful rather than like a task to check off.

Format the prompts in a way that is easy to scan and use immediately in my journal.
