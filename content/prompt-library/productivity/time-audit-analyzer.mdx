I need help analyzing how I spend my time to identify inefficiencies and reclaim lost hours.

My work situation is [WORK_TYPE:select:full-time employee,freelancer/consultant,business owner,student,stay-at-home parent,hybrid/multiple roles].

Here is how I typically spend my time during a [TIME_PERIOD:select:weekday,full week including weekends]:

[TIME_LOG]

For context, provide a detailed breakdown of your activities. You can share a rough estimate like "2 hours on email, 3 hours in meetings, 1 hour on social media" or paste an actual time tracking log if you have one.

My main goal is to have more time for [PRIMARY_GOAL], and I currently feel like [TIME_PAIN_POINT] is eating up too much of my day.

The activities I consider most valuable and want to protect are [HIGH_VALUE_ACTIVITIES]. The activities I suspect might be time wasters are [SUSPECTED_WASTERS?].

Please analyze my time usage and provide:

First, categorize all my activities into four buckets with the hours spent on each: high-value work that directly advances my goals, necessary tasks that must be done but could potentially be optimized, low-value activities that provide minimal return on time invested, and pure time wasters that should be eliminated or drastically reduced.

Second, identify the top three hidden time wasters I might not realize are costing me hours. For each one, explain why it is problematic and estimate how much time I could reclaim by addressing it.

Third, analyze my time patterns to find inefficiencies. Look for context switching that fragments my focus, tasks scheduled at suboptimal times of day, activities that could be batched or automated, and any misalignment between my stated goals and how I actually spend time.

Fourth, create a prioritized action plan with specific changes I can make this week. For each recommendation, explain what to change, how to implement it, and the expected time savings.

Finally, suggest a simple time tracking approach I can use going forward to maintain awareness of where my hours go.

Be direct and specific in your analysis. I want honest feedback, not validation of my current habits.
