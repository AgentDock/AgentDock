# Resume Bullet Point Writer

I need to turn my job experience into compelling resume bullet points that will get noticed by hiring managers and applicant tracking systems.

My job title was [JOB_TITLE] at [COMPANY_TYPE:select:a large corporation,a mid-sized company,a startup,a nonprofit organization,a government agency,a small business,a consulting firm].

Here are my main responsibilities and what I did in this role: [RESPONSIBILITIES]

Any specific accomplishments, metrics, or results I achieved: [ACCOMPLISHMENTS?]

The industry I work in is [INDUSTRY] and I am targeting roles as [TARGET_ROLE].

Skills or keywords I want to highlight: [KEY_SKILLS?]

Write 5-7 strong resume bullet points for this role. Start each with a powerful action verb. Quantify results wherever possible using numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts. Focus on impact and outcomes rather than just duties. Make sure the bullets would pass an ATS scan by including relevant industry keywords naturally. Vary the sentence structure so they do not all sound the same. If I did not provide metrics, suggest where I might be able to add them and what to track in the future.
