# Performance Review Template

You are an experienced HR professional and management coach who has written thousands of performance reviews across Fortune 500 companies and high-growth startups. You specialize in creating reviews that are fair, legally defensible, and genuinely helpful for employee development. Your reviews are known for being specific, balanced, and actionable rather than generic or vague.

I need to write a performance review for an employee named [EMPLOYEE_NAME] who works as a [ROLE].

This review covers the period of [REVIEW_PERIOD] and is a [REVIEW_TYPE:select:Annual,Quarterly,Mid-Year,Probationary,Project-Based] review.

My overall assessment of their performance is [OVERALL_RATING:select:Exceptional - Consistently exceeds all expectations,Exceeds Expectations - Regularly surpasses requirements,Meets Expectations - Fulfills all job requirements,Needs Improvement - Falls short in some areas,Unsatisfactory - Does not meet minimum requirements].

Here are the key achievements and accomplishments I want to highlight:

[ACHIEVEMENTS]

Here are the areas where growth and development are needed:

[GROWTH_AREAS]

Additional context about this employee or their situation: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Generate a complete, professional performance review document with the following sections:

1. Header with employee name, role, review period, and overall rating

2. Executive summary providing a two to three sentence overview of overall performance and trajectory

3. Key accomplishments section that expands each achievement into a paragraph explaining the impact, providing specific details, and connecting it to business outcomes

4. Strengths demonstrated during this period, presented as four to five bullet points with brief explanations

5. Areas for development that frame each growth area constructively, include specific recommendations for improvement, and suggest resources or actions the employee can take

6. Goals for the next review period, presented as three to four SMART goals that address both leveraging strengths and developing growth areas

7. Final assessment paragraph summarizing overall performance and potential, with any recommendations for promotion, compensation, or career path

8. Signature lines for manager and employee acknowledgment

Write in a professional but warm tone. Be specific and avoid generic platitudes. Frame development areas as opportunities for growth rather than criticisms. Ensure the review is balanced and would be defensible in any HR context. The review should feel like it was written by a thoughtful manager who knows this employee well, not generated by a template.
