# Code of Conduct Creator

You are an experienced policy advisor who has drafted codes of conduct for Fortune 500 companies, major open-source foundations, international conferences, and educational institutions. You understand how to balance clear behavioral expectations with a welcoming tone that encourages participation while maintaining accountability.

I need you to create a code of conduct for a [CONTEXT_TYPE:select:workplace,community,open-source project,event or conference,school or educational institution].

The organization or group is called [ORGANIZATION_NAME] and operates in the [PRIMARY_DOMAIN] space.

Our core values that should guide this code of conduct are: [VALUES]

The community or organization size is [SIZE:select:small (under 20 people),medium (20-100 people),large (100-500 people),very large (500+ people)] and our preferred enforcement approach is [ENFORCEMENT_APPROACH:select:restorative (focus on education and reconciliation),balanced (graduated responses based on severity),strict (clear consequences with limited flexibility)].

The primary contact for reporting violations is [REPORTING_CONTACT] and the code should comply with laws in [JURISDICTION].

The document tone should be [TONE:select:warm and welcoming,professional,formal and authoritative] and the length should be [LENGTH:select:concise (1-2 pages),comprehensive (3-5 pages),detailed (5+ pages with examples)].

Any additional context about our specific needs or concerns: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Your code of conduct must include these sections:

1. Opening statement - Explain the purpose of this code, who it applies to, and where it applies including both physical and digital spaces

2. Values and principles - Translate our core values into clear guiding principles that inform expected behavior

3. Expected behaviors - Provide specific examples of positive behaviors we want to encourage, tailored to our context type

4. Unacceptable behaviors - List behaviors that will not be tolerated, with concrete examples appropriate to our setting, including harassment, discrimination, and context-specific concerns

5. Enforcement and consequences - Describe the graduated response system aligned with our enforcement approach, from informal correction through warnings to suspension or removal

6. Reporting procedures - Explain exactly how to report violations, what information to include, expected response times, and confidentiality protections

7. Scope and applicability - Clarify when and where this code applies, including any representation of the organization in external settings

8. Amendments and review - Describe how this code can be updated and how often it will be reviewed

For open-source projects, also address contributor expectations around code review feedback, maintainer responsibilities, and asynchronous communication norms.

For events, include an incident response protocol for handling real-time situations and a safe space policy.

For workplaces, address relationships with customers, confidentiality obligations, and compliance with employment law.

For schools, address age-appropriate language, parent or guardian involvement in enforcement, and academic integrity.

Format the output with clear Markdown headings. Use bullet points for lists of behaviors. Include a final section for acknowledgment signatures if appropriate for the context. Write in second person to speak directly to the reader where it makes the code feel more personal and binding.
