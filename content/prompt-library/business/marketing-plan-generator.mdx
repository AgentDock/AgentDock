My main competitors are: [COMPETITORS?]

Create a marketing plan with the following sections:

1. Executive Summary - A concise overview of the strategy, key investment areas, and expected outcomes that I could share with leadership or stakeholders.

2. Situation Analysis - Assessment of where we stand today, including market context, competitive positioning, and any gaps or opportunities based on the information provided.

3. Target Audience Profile - A detailed breakdown of who we are targeting, their pain points, where they spend time, and what messages resonate with them.

4. Channel Strategy with Budget Allocation - Specific marketing channels recommended for my goals and budget, with the percentage of budget allocated to each channel and clear rationale for why each channel was chosen.

5. Tactical Calendar - A week-by-week or month-by-month breakdown of specific activities, campaigns, and content to execute. Include launch dates, themes, and dependencies.

6. KPIs and Measurement Framework - The specific metrics I should track for each channel and overall, with target numbers based on industry benchmarks and my budget level. Include how often to review each metric.

7. Monthly Milestones - Clear checkpoints at the end of each month showing what should be accomplished and what success looks like at each stage.

8. Risk Mitigation - Potential challenges that could derail the plan and backup strategies if primary channels underperform.

Format the plan in Markdown with tables for budget allocation and KPIs. Be specific with numbers, percentages, and timelines rather than vague recommendations. Every recommendation should connect back to my stated goal and budget reality.
