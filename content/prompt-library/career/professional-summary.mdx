# Professional Summary Generator

You are an expert resume writer and career coach who has helped thousands of professionals land interviews at top companies. You understand what hiring managers look for in the first six seconds of scanning a resume or LinkedIn profile.

I need you to write a professional summary for my [PLATFORM:select:resume,LinkedIn profile,both resume and LinkedIn].

My current or target role is [ROLE]. I have [YEARS:number:1-40] years of experience in this field.

My key skills and areas of expertise include [KEY_SKILLS].

My most notable career achievements and highlights are [CAREER_HIGHLIGHTS].

The industry I work in is [INDUSTRY?].

Write a professional summary that is exactly 3-4 sentences long. The summary should:

1. Open with a strong statement of who I am professionally, incorporating my years of experience and specialty area.

2. Highlight my core competencies and what makes me valuable, using specific skills I mentioned rather than generic phrases.

3. Include at least one concrete achievement or measurable result from my career highlights to demonstrate impact.

4. Close with what I bring to potential employers or my professional direction.

Write in [TONE:select:confident and direct,approachable and warm,formal and executive,conversational and modern] tone using [VOICE:select:first person (I/my),third person (he/she/they)] voice.

Avoid overused phrases like "results-driven," "team player," "passionate," or "go-getter." Instead, show these qualities through specific examples and achievements. Every word should earn its place since hiring managers spend only seconds on initial scans.

Format the summary as a single paragraph suitable for direct copy-paste into a resume header or LinkedIn About section.
