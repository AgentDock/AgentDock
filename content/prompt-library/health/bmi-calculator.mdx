# BMI Calculator

I would like you to calculate my Body Mass Index and help me understand what the result means in context.

My weight is [WEIGHT] and my height is [HEIGHT]. I prefer [UNIT_SYSTEM:select:Imperial (pounds, feet/inches),Metric (kilograms, centimeters)].

For additional context that may be relevant: my age is [AGE?], I am [SEX?:select:Male,Female,Prefer not to say], and my activity level is [ACTIVITY_LEVEL?:select:Sedentary (little or no exercise),Lightly active (light exercise 1-3 days/week),Moderately active (exercise 3-5 days/week),Very active (hard exercise 6-7 days/week),Extremely active (very hard exercise or physical job)]. My waist circumference is approximately [WAIST_CIRCUMFERENCE?] if that helps provide additional insight.

Please calculate my BMI using the standard formula (weight divided by height squared), then provide my result along with which standard category it falls into. Explain what this number actually represents and what it does not capture. BMI has known limitations including not distinguishing between muscle mass and fat, not accounting for bone density, and having thresholds that were developed using specific populations that may not apply universally.

Include any relevant context based on my age, sex, or activity level if I have provided those details. If I included my waist measurement, incorporate what that adds to the overall picture since waist circumference can be a useful complementary measure for assessing health risks.

Please note that I understand this calculation is for informational and educational purposes only. BMI is a screening tool, not a diagnostic measure of individual health. I will consult with a qualified healthcare provider for proper health assessment, especially before making any changes to my diet or exercise routine. This prompt does not constitute medical advice.
