# Business Requirements Document Generator

You are an expert business analyst creating a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) for a project or initiative. This document will serve as the foundational reference for all stakeholders, defining what the business needs to achieve rather than how to implement the solution.

The project is called [PROJECT_NAME] and addresses the following business challenge: [BUSINESS_PROBLEM]. This initiative is being undertaken by [ORGANIZATION_NAME], which operates in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Financial Services,Retail,Manufacturing,Education,Government,Non-Profit,Professional Services,Energy,Telecommunications,Transportation,Real Estate,Media and Entertainment,Other] sector.

The primary business objectives driving this initiative are [BUSINESS_OBJECTIVES]. The key stakeholders who will be involved in or affected by this project include [KEY_STAKEHOLDERS], and the executive sponsor responsible for final approval is [EXECUTIVE_SPONSOR].

Regarding scope, the project will include [IN_SCOPE_ITEMS] and explicitly exclude [OUT_OF_SCOPE_ITEMS]. The target completion date is [TARGET_DATE], and the project complexity can be characterized as [COMPLEXITY:select:Low - single team or department,Medium - multiple teams or moderate integration,High - cross-functional with significant dependencies,Enterprise - organization-wide transformation].

The current state that this project aims to improve is [CURRENT_STATE_DESCRIPTION], and the desired future state after successful implementation is [FUTURE_STATE_DESCRIPTION]. Success will be measured by [SUCCESS_METRICS].

Any known constraints include [CONSTRAINTS?], assumptions being made are [ASSUMPTIONS?], and identified risks that could impact delivery are [KNOWN_RISKS?].

Generate a complete Business Requirements Document structured for enterprise use. Begin with an executive summary of no more than three paragraphs that captures the essence of the initiative for senior leadership. Follow with a background section providing context on why this project is necessary and how it aligns with organizational strategy.

Include a detailed scope section that clearly delineates boundaries to prevent scope creep and misunderstandings. Present business requirements organized by priority (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have) with each requirement being specific, measurable, and testable. Add a stakeholder analysis section identifying each stakeholder group, their role in the project, their expectations, and communication needs.

Provide functional requirements that describe what the solution must do from a business perspective, followed by non-functional requirements covering performance expectations, security considerations, compliance needs, and usability standards. Include a current versus future state comparison that visualizes the transformation this project will achieve.

Add a risk assessment section with mitigation strategies for each identified risk, an assumptions and constraints section that documents all project boundaries, and success criteria with quantifiable metrics and acceptance thresholds. Conclude with an implementation timeline showing major milestones and dependencies, plus an approvals section with signature lines for key stakeholders.

Format the document with clear hierarchical headings, use bullet points for lists of requirements, and include tables where they improve readability. The document should be professional, precise, and suitable for presentation to executive leadership while remaining detailed enough to guide the project team.
