# AgentDock: Build Anything with AI Agents

AgentDock consists of two main components:

1. **AgentDock Core**: An open-source, backend-first framework for building and deploying sophisticated AI agents. It's designed to be framework-agnostic and provider-independent, giving you complete control over your agent's implementation.

2. **Next.js Implementation**: This repository includes a complete Next.js application that serves as a reference implementation and consumer of the AgentDock Core framework. You can see it in action at [https://hub.agentdock.ai](https://hub.agentdock.ai).

Built with TypeScript, AgentDock emphasizes simplicity, extensibility, and deterministic behavior.

## üß† Design Principles

AgentDock is built on these core principles:

- **Simplicity First**: Minimal code required to create functional agents
- **Node-Based Architecture**: All capabilities implemented as nodes
- **Tools as Specialized Nodes**: Tools extend the node system for agent capabilities
- **Configurable Determinism**: Control the predictability of agent behavior
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout

### Configurable Determinism

AgentDock balances deterministic and non-deterministic elements:
- AgentNodes are inherently non-deterministic as LLMs may generate different responses each time
- Workflows can be made more deterministic through defined tool execution paths
- Developers can control the level of determinism by configuring which parts of the system use LLM inference
- Even with LLM components, the overall system behavior remains predictable through structured tool interactions

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

The framework is built around a powerful node-based system:

- **BaseNode**: Foundation for all nodes, providing core functionality
- **AgentNode**: Specialized node for LLM-powered agents
- **Tools as Nodes**: Custom capabilities implemented as specialized nodes
- **Node Registry**: Central system for managing and connecting nodes

This architecture provides a consistent foundation for all capabilities while enabling extensibility through specialized node types.

For detailed documentation on AgentDock Core's architecture, design philosophy, and contribution guidelines, see [agentdock-core/README.md](agentdock-core/README.md).

## üîê Environment Configuration

AgentDock requires API keys for LLM providers to function.

### LLM Provider API Keys

Add your LLM provider API keys to your `.env.local` file for development. At least one provider key is required:

```bash
# LLM Provider API Keys - at least one is required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxx  # Anthropic API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx         # OpenAI API key
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxxxx            # Google Gemini API key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=xxxxxxx          # DeepSeek API key
GROQ_API_KEY=xxxxxxx              # Groq API key
```

### API Key Resolution

AgentDock follows a priority order when resolving which API key to use:

1. **Per-agent custom API key** (set via agent settings in the UI)
2. **Global settings API key** (set via the settings page in the UI)
3. **Environment variable** (from .env.local or deployment platform)

### Tool-specific API Keys

Some tools also require their own API keys, which are also configured through environment variables:

```bash
# Tool-specific API Keys
SERPER_API_KEY=                  # Required for search functionality
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=               # Required for deeper web search
```

For more details about environment configuration, see the implementation in [`src/types/env.ts`](src/types/env.ts).

## üß∞ Components

AgentDock's modular architecture is built upon these key components:

* **BaseNode**: The foundation for all nodes in the system
* **AgentNode**: The primary abstraction for agent functionality
* **Tools**: Functions callable by an LLM through the AgentNode
* **Node Registry**: Manages the registration and retrieval of all node types
* **Tool Registry**: Manages tool availability for agents
* **LLM Adapter**: Abstraction layer for interacting with LLMs
* **Provider Registry**: Manages LLM provider configurations
* **Error Handling**: System for handling errors and ensuring predictable behavior
* **Logging**: Structured logging system for monitoring and debugging

For detailed technical documentation on these components, see the [agentdock-core/README.md](agentdock-core/README.md).

## üìù Agent Templates

AgentDock includes several pre-configured agent templates in the `agents/` directory:

- **chat-agent**: General-purpose conversational assistant
- **research-agent**: Specialized assistant with search capabilities
- **example-agent**: Demonstrates core capabilities
- **Character-based agents**: Several personality-based agents (Chandler Bing, Dr. House, etc.)

Each agent is defined by a `template.json` file that specifies its configuration, personality, and available nodes.

## üíæ Storage System

AgentDock Core includes a secure storage system with ongoing development for advanced features:

* **Current Capabilities**: Secure encrypted storage for sensitive data
* **In Development**: Vector storage, pluggable backends, and working memory

See the [agentdock-core/README.md](agentdock-core/README.md#storage-system-development) for details on the storage system.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

* Node.js ‚â• 20.11.0 (LTS)
* pnpm ‚â• 9.15.0 (Required)
* API keys for LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Install pnpm**:

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   
   For a clean reinstallation (when you need to rebuild from scratch):
   ```bash
   pnpm run clean-install
   ```
   This script removes all node_modules, lock files, and reinstalls dependencies correctly.

3. **Configure Environment**:
   
   Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`:
   
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Then add your API keys to the `.env.local` file.

4. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Create Your First Agent**:
   - Configure your agent in the `agents` directory
   - Add custom nodes for your specific needs
   - Deploy anywhere

### Using Your Own API Keys

AgentDock follows a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model:

1. Add your API keys in the settings page of the application
2. Alternatively, provide keys via request headers for direct API usage
3. Keys are securely stored using the built-in encryption system
4. No API keys are shared or stored on our servers

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains:

1. **AgentDock Core**: The core framework located in `agentdock-core/`
2. **Next.js Implementation**: A complete reference implementation and consumer of the AgentDock Core framework
3. **Example Agents**: Ready-to-use agent configurations in the `agents/` directory

You can use AgentDock Core independently in your own applications, or use this repository as a starting point for building your own agent-powered applications.
