# Request For Agents (RFA)

> Build powerful AI agents with AgentDock's node-based architecture

## What are Requests For Agents?

Requests For Agents (RFAs) are specifications for AI agents that solve real-world problems using the AgentDock framework. Each RFA provides a clear problem statement, implementation guidance using AgentDock's node system, and resources to help you build an effective agent.
