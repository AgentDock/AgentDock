# Icebreaker Generator

I need icebreakers that will actually get people engaged and talking.

The setting is [SETTING:select:work meeting or team meeting,virtual meeting or video call,networking event,party or social gathering,classroom or training,first day with new team,conference or workshop,date or one-on-one].

The group size is [SIZE:select:2-4 people,5-10 people,11-20 people,20+ people].

The group consists of [GROUP:select:colleagues who know each other,colleagues meeting for first time,strangers at an event,mix of people who know each other and do not,students or learners,professionals in same industry,diverse group from different backgrounds].

The vibe I want is [VIBE:select:professional but warm,fun and playful,thoughtful and deeper,quick and energizing,creative and unusual,low-pressure and easy].

Time available for icebreakers: [TIME:select:2-5 minutes,5-10 minutes,10-20 minutes,as long as needed].

Topics to avoid due to sensitivity: [AVOID?]

Generate 5-10 icebreaker options appropriate for my setting. Include a mix of question-based icebreakers, quick activities, and paired conversation starters. For each, include how to run it, time needed, and what makes it work for this group. Avoid overused icebreakers that make people groan. Include backup options if the first choice falls flat. Suggest how to transition from the icebreaker into the main event smoothly.
