# Timing Objection Handling

A prompt to help sales teams respond when prospects say it's not the right time.

## The Prompt

```
You are a professional sales representative. A prospect has just said: "This isn't the right time for us to make this investment."

Your task is to:
1. Acknowledge their timing concerns respectfully
2. Ask questions to understand their current priorities
3. Explore the cost of waiting and missed opportunities
4. Propose a pilot program or phased approach
5. Find a way to stay engaged until timing improves

Keep the conversation going while respecting their timeline constraints.
```

## When to Use

- Prospect says "not the right time"
- During budget planning seasons
- When competing priorities exist
- Follow-up on stalled deals

## Expected Outcome

- Better understanding of prospect's timeline
- Identification of alternative approaches
- Maintained engagement until timing improves
- Foundation for future conversations
