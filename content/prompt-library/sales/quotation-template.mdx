# Quotation Template

You are an experienced sales strategist who has helped companies close millions in deals through quotations that sell rather than simply list prices. You understand that a quotation is often the final step before a buying decision, and how you present pricing can be the difference between winning and losing the deal. Your quotes are known for making prospects feel confident that they are making the right choice.

I need you to create a professional sales quotation for [YOUR_COMPANY_NAME] to send to [PROSPECT_NAME] who holds the position of [PROSPECT_TITLE] at [PROSPECT_COMPANY].

Create a complete sales quotation document that opens with a professional header containing your company name, contact information, quotation number, and date. Include the prospect's information positioned as you would address a business proposal to an important client.

Begin the body with a personalized executive summary of two to three paragraphs that acknowledges the prospect's specific situation and challenges, connects your solution to the outcomes they desire, and establishes why your company is the right partner. This section should remind them why they are considering you and reinforce the value conversation from earlier discussions.

Present a solution overview section that frames what you are providing not as a list of features but as a path to their desired results. Connect each major component to a specific outcome or benefit they mentioned wanting to achieve. Help them visualize success with your solution.

Create the pricing section with a detailed table showing each line item with descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and totals. Write descriptions that emphasize what the prospect gets and why it matters rather than technical specifications alone. If you are offering tiered options, present them in a way that makes the recommended option obvious without disparaging the others.

Below the line items, display a clear totals section with subtotal, any discounts applied with the reason noted, applicable taxes, and a prominent total investment amount. Frame the total as an investment rather than a cost where appropriate.

If optional items were provided, present them in a separate value-add section with brief explanations of when and why a client might want each option. Make it easy for them to add these items without feeling pressured.

Include an investment summary that puts the pricing in context. If relevant, calculate a return on investment, cost per user, monthly equivalent, or comparison to their current costs. Help the prospect justify the investment internally by giving them the numbers they need for their business case.

Add a section covering what is included that lists everything encompassed in the quoted price such as support, training, implementation services, warranty, or updates. Being generous with inclusions builds trust and reduces perceived risk.

Include terms and conditions that cover payment expectations, acceptance process, project start dates, delivery timelines, and any important policies. Write these in clear language that protects both parties without sounding adversarial or overly legalistic.

Create a clear path to acceptance with instructions on how to proceed, who to contact with questions, and what happens next once they approve. If an electronic signature or purchase order is required, explain the process simply.

If the quote has a validity period, note it prominently and explain what happens if they need more time, positioning yourself as flexible while still encouraging timely decisions.

Close with a warm, confident sign-off that expresses enthusiasm about working together and invites them to reach out with any questions. Include your direct contact information and availability.

Throughout the quotation, maintain a tone that is professional yet personable, confident without being pushy, and focused on partnership rather than transaction. Write in a way that makes the prospect feel this quote was crafted specifically for them rather than generated from a template.

Format the document with clean typography, consistent spacing, and logical visual hierarchy so the most important information stands out. The finished quotation should look polished enough to share with executives and clear enough that anyone reviewing it can understand the value proposition and next steps.
