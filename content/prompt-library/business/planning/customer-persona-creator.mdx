My business offers [PRODUCT_OR_SERVICE] in the [INDUSTRY] industry.

My target market is [TARGET_MARKET] (describe who you currently sell to or want to sell to).

The main problem or need I solve for customers: [PROBLEM_SOLVED]

What customers typically consider before buying: [BUYING_CONSIDERATIONS]

Current customer data or insights I have: [EXISTING_DATA?]

I need [NUMBER:select:1,2,3] persona(s) for [PERSONA_PURPOSE:select:marketing and advertising,product development,sales conversations,content creation,all of the above].

Create detailed customer persona(s) that include a memorable name and brief bio, demographic information like age range, location, income, and occupation, psychographic details like values, interests, and lifestyle, their specific goals and pain points related to my offering, how they make purchasing decisions and who influences them, where they spend time online and offline, objections or hesitations they might have, and messaging that would resonate with them. Make the persona feel like a real person I can picture. Include quotes they might say. Suggest how I should approach each persona differently in my marketing or sales.
