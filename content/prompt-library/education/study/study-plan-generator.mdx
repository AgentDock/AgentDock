# Study Plan Generator

I need a realistic study plan that will help me learn effectively without burning out.

I am studying for [STUDY_GOAL] (such as an exam, certification, skill, or subject).

The topics or material I need to cover: [TOPICS_TO_COVER]

I have [TIMEFRAME:select:1 week,2 weeks,1 month,2-3 months,6 months or more] until my deadline or target date.

I can dedicate [DAILY_TIME:select:30 minutes per day,1 hour per day,2 hours per day,3-4 hours per day,more than 4 hours per day] to studying.

My preferred study times are [STUDY_TIME:select:early morning,during the day,evening,late night,whenever I can fit it in].

My learning style is [LEARNING_STYLE:select:reading and taking notes,watching videos and tutorials,hands-on practice and exercises,teaching others or explaining out loud,a mix of everything].

Topics I already know well or can skip: [KNOWN_TOPICS?]

Create a complete study plan that breaks down what I should cover each week and each day. Prioritize the most important or difficult topics when my energy is highest. Include time for review and practice, not just learning new material. Build in rest days or lighter days to prevent burnout. Suggest specific study techniques for the type of material I am learning. Include milestones so I can track my progress. If my timeline is too aggressive, tell me honestly and suggest what to prioritize.
