# Movie Recommendation Finder

I need help picking a movie to watch.

I am in the mood for something [MOOD:select:fun and lighthearted,thrilling and suspenseful,thought-provoking and deep,romantic,scary,action-packed,emotional and moving,visually stunning,nostalgic,I am open to anything].

Genres I enjoy: [GENRES]

I am watching [WATCHING_WITH:select:alone,with my partner,with friends,with family including kids,on a date].

If kids, their ages and what is appropriate: [KID_APPROPRIATE?]

Movies I have loved and why: [FAVORITE_MOVIES]

Movies or styles I want to avoid: [AVOID?]

How much time I have: [TIME:select:under 90 minutes,standard length 90-120 minutes,fine with long movies,open to miniseries or multi-part].

What era: [ERA:select:recent releases - last few years,classics from any era,mix of old and new,specific decade - I will specify].

If specific era: [SPECIFIC_ERA?]

Suggest 5-7 movies that match my mood and preferences. For each, include a brief non-spoiler description of why I would enjoy it, the runtime and year, and any content warnings for family viewing. Note if any are streaming on major platforms. Include at least one unexpected pick that might be outside my usual taste but fits my current mood. Tell me which one to watch first.
