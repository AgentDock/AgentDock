# Customer Complaint Response

I need to respond to a customer complaint in a way that addresses their concerns and maintains a positive relationship.

Here is the customer complaint or message: [CUSTOMER_COMPLAINT]

The type of issue is [ISSUE_TYPE:select:product quality or defect,shipping or delivery problem,billing or payment error,poor service experience,feature request or limitation,misunderstanding or miscommunication,policy dispute,technical issue or bug].

What actually happened or the root cause: [ROOT_CAUSE?]

What I can offer as a resolution: [RESOLUTION_OFFER] (such as refund, replacement, credit, fix, explanation, etc.)

Our company policy on this type of issue: [POLICY?]

The customer's history with us is [CUSTOMER_HISTORY:select:new customer first purchase,occasional customer,loyal regular customer,VIP or high-value customer,previously had issues,unknown].

Write a professional response email that acknowledges their frustration, takes responsibility where appropriate without over-apologizing, clearly explains the resolution I am offering, and closes in a way that invites continued relationship. The tone should be [TONE:select:empathetic and warm,professional and solution-focused,sincere and apologetic,calm and reassuring]. Avoid corporate jargon and defensive language.
