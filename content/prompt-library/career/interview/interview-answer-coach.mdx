# Interview Answer Coach

I have an upcoming interview and need help preparing strong answers that showcase my experience and fit for the role.

The interview question I need to answer is: [INTERVIEW_QUESTION]

This is a [QUESTION_TYPE:select:behavioral question - tell me about a time when,technical or skill-based question,general question like tell me about yourself,situational or hypothetical question,question about weaknesses or challenges,salary or compensation question,question about why I want this job or am leaving my current one].

The role I am interviewing for is [ROLE] at a company in the [INDUSTRY] industry.

Relevant experience or stories I can draw from: [RELEVANT_EXPERIENCE]

Key strengths or qualities I want to highlight: [STRENGTHS?]

Help me craft a strong answer to this question. If it is a behavioral question, structure it using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Make sure my answer is specific and uses concrete examples rather than generic statements. Keep it concise enough to deliver in 1-2 minutes. Suggest a strong opening line that hooks the interviewer. Point out any common mistakes to avoid with this type of question. Give me a version I can practice and then adapt in my own words.
