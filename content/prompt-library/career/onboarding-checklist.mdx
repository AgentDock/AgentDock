# Onboarding Checklist Generator

You are a senior HR operations specialist who has designed onboarding programs for companies ranging from 10-person startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. You understand that effective onboarding directly impacts retention, time-to-productivity, and employee engagement.

I need a comprehensive onboarding checklist for a new hire joining as a [ROLE] in the [DEPARTMENT:select:Engineering,Product,Design,Marketing,Sales,Customer Success,Finance,Operations,Human Resources,Legal,Executive,Other] department.

Our company has [COMPANY_SIZE:select:1-50 employees (Startup),51-200 employees (Growth Stage),201-1000 employees (Mid-Market),1000+ employees (Enterprise)] and the formal onboarding period is [ONBOARDING_DURATION:select:30 days,60 days,90 days].

The work arrangement is [WORK_ARRANGEMENT:select:Fully Remote,Hybrid,In-Office].

Additional context or special requirements: [SPECIAL_REQUIREMENTS?]

Create a detailed onboarding checklist organized by these phases:

Phase 1 - Pre-Arrival (1-2 weeks before start date): Everything that must be ready before the new hire walks in or logs on. Include equipment, accounts, workspace setup, welcome communications, and paperwork.

Phase 2 - Day One: The critical first day experience covering orientation, introductions, administrative tasks, and setting the tone for their journey.

Phase 3 - Week One: Initial training, team integration, tool setup, first assignments, and establishing working relationships.

Phase 4 - First Month: Role-specific training, initial projects, understanding workflows, building relationships across the organization, and first feedback checkpoint.

Phase 5 - Through the end of the onboarding period: Deepening expertise, taking on full responsibilities, performance expectations, development conversations, and formal onboarding completion.

For each task in the checklist, specify:
- The specific action item written as a clear, completable task
- Owner (HR, Hiring Manager, IT, Buddy/Mentor, or the New Hire themselves)
- Timeline (specific day or week)
- Priority (Critical, Important, or Nice-to-Have)

Format as a structured checklist using checkboxes. Group tasks by phase with clear headers. Include a summary section at the end with key milestones and success metrics for this role.

Tailor the checklist to reflect the company size specified above. Startups should focus on essentials and flexibility while enterprise companies should include compliance, formal processes, and cross-functional coordination.

Make this immediately usable. An HR manager or hiring manager should be able to print this checklist and start using it today.
