# Home Organization Plan

I want to organize my home but feel overwhelmed about where to start.

The areas I need to organize are: [AREAS] (such as closet, kitchen, garage, home office, kids rooms, etc.)

The main problem is [PROBLEM:select:too much stuff and clutter,disorganization - things have no home,a recent move and need to set up systems,a major life change like new baby or roommate,just general chaos that built up over time].

My time availability is [TIME:select:15-30 minutes per day,a few hours on weekends,one dedicated weekend to tackle it all,sporadic time when I can fit it in].

My organizing style is [STYLE:select:minimalist - less is more,practical - everything needs a purpose,sentimental - I keep things with memories,visual - I need to see things to remember them,hidden - I prefer things out of sight].

Current storage and organization supplies I have: [SUPPLIES?]

Budget for new organization products: [BUDGET:select:minimal - use what I have,moderate - can buy some basics,flexible - willing to invest in good systems].

Create a step-by-step organization plan that prioritizes areas by impact. Break tasks into manageable chunks that fit my available time. For each area, tell me how to sort and declutter, what to keep versus donate versus trash, and what organization systems to set up. Suggest storage solutions appropriate for my style and budget. Include maintenance tips so the organization lasts. Give me a realistic timeline and celebrate small wins along the way.
