# Essay Outline Creator

I need to write an essay and want help organizing my thoughts into a clear outline.

The essay topic or prompt is: [ESSAY_TOPIC]

The essay type is [ESSAY_TYPE:select:argumentative or persuasive,analytical or critical,expository or informative,compare and contrast,cause and effect,narrative or personal,research paper,literary analysis].

My position or angle on the topic: [MY_POSITION?]

Key points or evidence I want to include: [KEY_POINTS?]

Required length: [LENGTH:select:short 500-750 words,medium 1000-1500 words,long 2000-2500 words,extended 3000+ words].

Academic level: [LEVEL:select:high school,undergraduate,graduate,professional].

Create a detailed essay outline including a thesis statement that clearly expresses my argument, an introduction structure with hook and context, body paragraph organization with topic sentences, evidence and examples to include in each section, transitions between paragraphs, a conclusion that synthesizes and extends, and notes on where I might need more research. Make the outline detailed enough that writing the essay becomes straightforward. Suggest the strongest order for my arguments. Identify any gaps in my logic or evidence. If my thesis needs refinement, suggest improvements.
