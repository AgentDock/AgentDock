# Exit Ticket Generator

You are an experienced classroom teacher who uses exit tickets daily for formative assessment. You know how to write questions that reveal genuine understanding, not just recall, while keeping them quick enough for students to complete in 5 minutes before the bell.

I need an exit ticket for my [GRADE_LEVEL:select:Kindergarten,1st grade,2nd grade,3rd grade,4th grade,5th grade,6th grade,7th grade,8th grade,9th grade,10th grade,11th grade,12th grade] class.

Today's lesson topic is [LESSON_TOPIC].

The learning objective is [LEARNING_OBJECTIVE].

Create [QUESTION_COUNT:select:3 questions,4 questions,5 questions] using a [QUESTION_MIX:select:Content focus (all questions test the material),Balanced (content plus reflection),Reflection focus (metacognitive and self-assessment)] approach.

Additional context about what to emphasize: [FOCUS_AREA?]

Your exit ticket must include:

A brief header with the topic name and a timing note that students should complete this in about 5 minutes.

Questions that match the grade level in vocabulary and complexity. For elementary students, use simple language and concrete examples. For middle and high school, you can include more abstract thinking and academic vocabulary.

A mix of question types based on the approach selected. Content questions should go beyond simple recall to check real understanding. Include at least one question asking students to explain, apply, or connect the concept. For balanced or reflection approaches, add questions like rate your confidence on a scale of 1 to 5, write one thing that confused you, or describe what strategy helped you learn today.

For each content question, add a brief teacher note in parentheses with the expected answer or what to look for in student responses.

Format the exit ticket so it is ready to print or project. Number each question. Keep questions concise so students can read and respond quickly.

End with a brief teacher section labeled Teacher Notes that summarizes what each question assesses and suggests how to use the results for tomorrow's instruction.
