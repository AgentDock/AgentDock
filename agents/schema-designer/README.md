# Data Schema Designer

A schema generator that builds optimized database structures for applications of various sizes and requirements.

## Schema Components

```mermaid
erDiagram
    DATABASE ||--o{ TABLE : contains
    TABLE ||--|{ COLUMN : has
    TABLE ||--o{ INDEX : optimizes
    TABLE ||--o{ CONSTRAINT : enforces
```

## Relationship Types

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ ITEM : "ordered as"
```

## Core Functions

- Create normalized data models from requirements
- Design entity relationships with appropriate constraints
- Implement indexing strategies for query optimization
- Generate Mermaid diagrams for data visualization
- Support multiple database types (relational, document, graph)

## Use Cases

- New application database design
- Complex domain modeling
- Schema migration planning
- Analytics system optimization
- Query-optimized structure creation

## Basic Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Designer: App requirements
    Designer->>User: DB recommendations
    User->>Designer: Confirm approach
    Designer->>User: Schema draft
    User->>Designer: Refinement requests
    Designer->>User: Optimized schema
```

## Schema Components

- Entity definitions with field types
- Relationship mappings and cardinality
- Constraint definitions
- Index placement recommendations
- Ready-to-use DDL scripts
- Visual ER diagrams
- Performance notes

## Benefits

- Optimized schema design from start
- Clear visualization of data relationships
- Standards-compliant database structures
- Prevention of common data modeling errors
- Scalable foundation for applications
