# Morning Routine Builder

I want to build a morning routine that actually works for my life and helps me start the day right.

I wake up at [WAKE_TIME] and need to leave or start work by [START_TIME].

My mornings are currently [CURRENT_MORNING:select:chaotic and rushed,slow and unproductive,non-existent - I wake up at the last minute,okay but could be better,already have a routine but want to improve it].

My main goal for a morning routine is [GOAL:select:more energy throughout the day,increased productivity and focus,better mental health and less anxiety,physical fitness,time for personal development,just feeling more put together,a combination of benefits].

I am [MORNING_PERSON:select:definitely a morning person,not a morning person at all,somewhere in between,trying to become more of a morning person].

Responsibilities that compete for morning time: [RESPONSIBILITIES?] (such as kids, pets, partner, commute, etc.)

Physical activities I enjoy or want to include: [ACTIVITIES?]

Create a realistic morning routine that fits my available time. Break it into phases like waking up, personal care, energizing activities, and preparation. Include specific time estimates for each element. Start with non-negotiables and build from there. Suggest how to protect the routine on busy days. Include tips for waking up easier. Address my specific goal with targeted activities. Suggest a gradual implementation plan rather than changing everything at once. Include what to do the night before to set up success.
