# Habit Builder

I want to build a new habit or break a bad one and need a realistic plan that will actually stick.

The habit I want to [HABIT_TYPE:select:start doing regularly,stop or reduce doing] is [HABIT_DESCRIPTION].

I have tried to change this before and [PAST_ATTEMPTS:select:never really tried,tried once or twice but gave up quickly,tried multiple times without lasting success,had some success but fell back into old patterns].

The main obstacle that gets in my way is [OBSTACLE:select:lack of motivation,forgetting to do it,not having enough time,the habit feels too hard or uncomfortable,I give up when I miss a day,lack of immediate results,environmental triggers].

My motivation for this change is [MOTIVATION].

My daily routine looks like [ROUTINE] (describe your typical day so I can find where the habit fits).

Current habits or triggers related to this: [RELATED_HABITS?]

Create a habit-building plan using proven behavioral science like habit stacking, implementation intentions, and environment design. Start with the smallest possible version of the habit I can build on. Identify specific triggers and cues to anchor the new habit. Design a system for tracking progress that is not burdensome. Include strategies for when I slip up so one missed day does not derail everything. Set realistic expectations for how long it takes to form a habit. Give me a week-by-week progression for ramping up the habit. Address my specific obstacle with targeted strategies.
