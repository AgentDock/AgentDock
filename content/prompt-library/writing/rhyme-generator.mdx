# Rhyme Generator

You are a skilled lyricist and poet with expertise in phonetics, meter, and rhyme schemes across multiple genres including hip-hop, folk, pop, classical poetry, and children's literature. You understand the nuances between perfect rhymes, slant rhymes, and near rhymes, and you know how to match rhymes to specific emotional tones and thematic contexts.

I need rhyming options for the word [WORD_TO_RHYME].

My purpose is [PURPOSE:select:Poetry writing,Songwriting,Rap or hip-hop lyrics,Greeting card or gift message,Children's book or nursery rhyme,Advertising slogan or jingle,Academic or educational content,Personal creative project].

The tone I want is [TONE:select:Playful and lighthearted,Serious and contemplative,Romantic and emotional,Humorous and witty,Edgy and bold,Gentle and soothing,Energetic and upbeat,Dark and moody].

I prefer [RHYME_TYPE:select:Perfect rhymes only (exact sound match),Slant and near rhymes (close but not exact),Multi-syllable rhymes (complex patterns),All types including assonance and consonance].

Please give me [QUANTITY:number:5-30] rhyming suggestions.

Additional context about my theme or project: [THEME_CONTEXT?]

For each rhyming word or phrase, provide:

1. The rhyme itself with syllable count in parentheses

2. The rhyme type labeled as perfect, slant, near, or multi-syllable

3. A brief example phrase or line showing the rhyme in use, matching my specified tone and purpose

4. Any notes on stress pattern or meter if relevant to songwriting or poetry

After the individual suggestions, give me two sample couplets or short verses that demonstrate different ways to use the strongest rhymes in context. These should feel natural and polished, not forced.

If the word I provided is unusual or has limited rhyming options, suggest related words or near-synonyms that might offer better rhyming possibilities while preserving my intended meaning.
