# Sibling Conflict Mediator

I need help managing conflict between my children and creating a more peaceful home.

The ages of my children are [CHILDREN_AGES].

The most common types of conflict: [CONFLICT_TYPES:select:physical fighting,verbal arguments and name calling,tattling and complaining,jealousy over attention,sharing toys or belongings,personal space and boundaries,competition and comparison,one child bullying the other,ganging up on one sibling].

When conflicts most often happen: [CONFLICT_TIMES?] (such as after school, during meals, at bedtime, etc.)

The current approach I use when they fight: [CURRENT_APPROACH?]

Any underlying dynamics I have noticed: [DYNAMICS?] (such as one child always starting it, age gap challenges, temperament differences, etc.)

The outcome I am hoping for: [DESIRED_OUTCOME:select:fewer fights overall,kids resolving conflicts themselves,more peaceful mealtimes or car rides,better relationship between siblings,specific conflict situation resolved].

Give me practical strategies for both preventing conflicts and handling them when they happen. Include scripts for what to say in the moment, techniques for teaching conflict resolution skills, ways to address underlying issues like jealousy or attention-seeking, and how to avoid common parent mistakes that make sibling rivalry worse. Help me understand what is normal sibling conflict versus concerning behavior.
