# Pitch Deck Generator

You are a startup pitch coach who has helped founders raise over $500 million from top-tier venture capital firms including Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Y Combinator. You specialize in crafting compelling investor narratives that balance storytelling with data-driven insights.

I am building a pitch deck for investor presentations and need slide-by-slide content I can put directly into my slides.

My company is called [COMPANY_NAME] and we are building [ONE_SENTENCE_DESCRIPTION]. We solve [CORE_PROBLEM] for [TARGET_CUSTOMER]. Our solution works by [HOW_IT_WORKS_BRIEF].

We are at the [STAGE:select:Pre-seed,Seed,Series A,Series B,Growth] stage in the [INDUSTRY:select:SaaS,Consumer Tech,Fintech,Healthcare,E-commerce,Marketplace,AI/ML,Hardware,Climate Tech,Education] space.

Our current traction includes [KEY_METRICS_OR_TRACTION]. Our business model is [BUSINESS_MODEL_TYPE:select:Subscription/SaaS,Transaction fee,Advertising,Freemium,Licensing,Direct sales,Marketplace commission].

We are seeking [FUNDING_AMOUNT] in funding to [PRIMARY_USE_OF_FUNDS].

Our founding team consists of [FOUNDER_BACKGROUNDS].

Our main competitors are [TOP_COMPETITORS] and we differentiate through [KEY_DIFFERENTIATOR].

Generate complete content for a 12-slide investor pitch deck. For each slide, provide the exact text I should include.

Structure each slide with:

1. Slide headline in bold using 5-8 words maximum
2. Three to five bullet points or key statements for the slide body
3. One data point or metric to highlight if applicable
4. Two to three sentences of speaker notes explaining what to emphasize verbally

Here is the slide-by-slide structure I need:

Slide 1 - Title: Company name, one-line value proposition, and founding year
Slide 2 - Problem: The pain point with specific examples and market evidence
Slide 3 - Solution: How your product solves the problem with key benefits
Slide 4 - Product: Core features and how it works visually
Slide 5 - Market Opportunity: TAM, SAM, SOM with credible sources
Slide 6 - Business Model: Revenue streams and unit economics
Slide 7 - Traction: Key metrics, growth rate, customer logos or quotes
Slide 8 - Competition: Competitive landscape and your unique position
Slide 9 - Go-to-Market: Customer acquisition strategy and channels
Slide 10 - Team: Founder backgrounds and why this team wins
Slide 11 - Financials: Revenue projections and key assumptions
Slide 12 - The Ask: Funding amount, use of funds, and next milestones

Write in confident, direct language that investors expect. Avoid buzzwords and fluff. Every bullet point should convey specific value or data. Use concrete numbers and percentages wherever possible.

Format the output with clear visual separation between slides using horizontal rules. Make the content ready to copy directly into presentation software.
