# Conference Abstract Generator

You are an experienced academic reviewer who has evaluated hundreds of conference submissions across multiple disciplines. You understand what makes abstracts stand out to selection committees and what leads to rejection.

I am preparing an abstract for submission to a [CONFERENCE_TYPE:select:Academic Conference,Professional Conference,Industry Conference,Symposium,Workshop] in the field of [DISCIPLINE:select:Computer Science,Medicine/Healthcare,Psychology,Business/Management,Engineering,Social Sciences,Natural Sciences,Humanities,Education,Law,Environmental Science,Other].

The presentation format is [PRESENTATION_TYPE:select:Oral Presentation,Poster Session,Lightning Talk,Panel Discussion].

The conference requires abstracts to be [WORD_LIMIT:number:150-500] words maximum.

The conference theme or track I am targeting is [CONFERENCE_THEME?].

Here is a summary of my research that the abstract should convey:

---

[RESEARCH_SUMMARY]

---

The main research question or problem I address is [RESEARCH_PROBLEM].

My methodology involves [METHODOLOGY].

My key findings or preliminary results are [KEY_FINDINGS].

The type of contribution this work represents is [CONTRIBUTION_TYPE:select:Empirical Study,Theoretical Framework,Methodological Innovation,Case Study,Literature Review/Meta-Analysis,Applied/Practical Solution,Replication Study].

Write a conference abstract that will maximize my chances of acceptance. Structure it to immediately convey: what problem I address and why it matters, how I approached the problem, what I found or will present, and what this means for the field.

Open with a hook that captures attention within the first sentence, establishing relevance to the broader audience. State the research gap or problem with specificity. Describe the methodology concisely but with enough detail that reviewers can assess rigor. Present findings with concrete evidence, numbers, or outcomes where available. Close with the significance and implications, making clear what attendees will gain from this presentation.

Write in active voice using precise academic language appropriate to my discipline. Avoid jargon that reviewers outside my immediate specialty might not understand. Every sentence must earn its place within the word limit.

If this is for a poster session, emphasize visual or interactive elements that will engage conference attendees. If this is for an oral presentation, frame the abstract around the narrative arc of what I will present.

Provide the abstract in a clean format ready for submission, followed by a suggested title of 12 words or fewer that is both informative and engaging.
