# Property Valuation Assessment

I need a comprehensive property valuation analysis for a property I'm evaluating. The property is located at [PROPERTY_ADDRESS] in [CITY_STATE_ZIP]. This is a [PROPERTY_TYPE:select:single-family home,condominium,townhouse,multi-family (2-4 units),vacant land,commercial property] with [BEDROOMS:number:1-10] bedrooms and [BATHROOMS:number:1-8] bathrooms, totaling approximately [SQUARE_FEET] square feet of living space on a [LOT_SIZE] lot. The property was built in [YEAR_BUILT] and I would describe its current condition as [CONDITION:select:excellent,good,fair,needs work,major renovation required].

Recent updates or improvements include [RECENT_UPDATES_OR_NONE]. The property has these notable features: [NOTABLE_FEATURES?]. My purpose for this valuation is [PURPOSE:select:considering selling,preparing to buy,refinancing,estate planning,investment analysis,property tax appeal,general curiosity].

Please analyze this property using three established valuation methodologies. First, conduct a comparable sales analysis by examining what similar properties in this area have sold for recently, adjusting for differences in size, condition, features, and location quality. Second, apply the cost approach by estimating the land value plus the replacement cost of improvements minus depreciation. Third, if applicable to this property type, use the income approach by estimating rental potential and applying appropriate capitalization rates.

After working through each methodology, synthesize your findings into a single estimated value range with a most probable value point. Explain which approach you weighted most heavily and why. Identify the three to five factors that most significantly impact this property's value, both positively and negatively. Conclude with specific recommendations for my stated purpose, including any steps I should take to verify or refine this estimate.
