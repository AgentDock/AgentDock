# Fitness Plan Generator

I want to create a personalized fitness plan tailored to my specific situation and goals. Here is the information you need to design my program.

My current fitness level is [FITNESS_LEVEL:select:complete beginner with no exercise experience,beginner with some basic activity,intermediate with consistent workout history,advanced with years of training experience,returning after a long break from exercise]. My primary fitness goal is [GOAL:select:build muscle and increase strength,lose body fat while maintaining muscle,improve cardiovascular endurance,enhance overall fitness and health,train for a specific sport or activity,increase flexibility and mobility,build functional strength for daily life]. I want to achieve meaningful progress within [DURATION:select:4 weeks as a starter program,8 weeks for noticeable changes,12 weeks for significant transformation,6 months for major results,ongoing program with long-term focus].

I can commit to working out [DAYS_PER_WEEK:select:2 days per week,3 days per week,4 days per week,5 days per week,6 days per week] and each session can last [SESSION_LENGTH:select:20-30 minutes,30-45 minutes,45-60 minutes,60-90 minutes]. For equipment, I have access to [EQUIPMENT:select:no equipment at all - bodyweight only,minimal equipment like resistance bands and a mat,dumbbells and basic home gym items,full home gym with weights and machines,commercial gym with complete equipment,outdoor space for running and park workouts]. My preferred training style is [TRAINING_STYLE:select:strength training with weights,bodyweight and calisthenics,high-intensity interval training,steady-state cardio focused,mixed training with variety,circuit training style,yoga and mobility centered].

My age is [AGE] years old. Any injuries, physical limitations, or health conditions I should mention are [LIMITATIONS?]. My typical schedule availability is [SCHEDULE:select:mornings before work,lunch breaks during the day,evenings after work,weekends primarily,flexible throughout the day,varies week to week]. I sleep approximately [SLEEP:select:less than 6 hours per night,6-7 hours per night,7-8 hours per night,8 or more hours per night] and my stress level is generally [STRESS:select:low and manageable,moderate with occasional peaks,high with frequent stress,very high and constant].

Please create a comprehensive fitness plan that includes a weekly workout schedule showing which muscle groups or training focus for each day. For each workout, provide specific exercises with sets, repetitions, and rest periods appropriate for my level. Include warm-up routines to prepare my body and cool-down stretches for recovery. Build in progressive overload by showing how to increase difficulty over time through added weight, reps, or intensity. Provide modifications for any exercises if I have the limitations mentioned, and offer alternatives if certain equipment becomes unavailable.

Include guidance on rest days and active recovery strategies. Give me tips for tracking my progress and knowing when to adjust the plan. Address how nutrition and hydration support my specific goal without providing a full meal plan. Explain what to expect in terms of realistic results within my chosen timeframe.

This fitness plan is for educational and informational purposes. Please include a reminder that I should consult with a healthcare provider or qualified fitness professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if I have existing health conditions, injuries, or concerns about my ability to exercise safely.
