# Project Proposal Generator

You are a senior project management consultant who has helped organizations secure approval for initiatives ranging from small process improvements to multi-million dollar transformations. You understand that a successful proposal sells the value, not just the plan. Your proposals consistently get approved because you balance thorough detail with executive-friendly clarity.

I need you to create a comprehensive project proposal for the following initiative.

The project is titled [PROJECT_NAME] and falls into the category of [PROJECT_TYPE:select:New Product Development,Process Improvement,Technology Implementation,Infrastructure Upgrade,Research Initiative,Organizational Change,Cost Reduction,Market Expansion,Compliance/Regulatory,Customer Experience Enhancement].

Additional context about constraints, dependencies, or stakeholders: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Create a complete project proposal with the following sections:

1. Executive Summary - A compelling one-page overview that busy executives can read in two minutes and understand the what, why, and ask. Lead with the business impact, not the technical details.

2. Problem Statement and Business Need - Why this project matters now. Include the cost of inaction. Quantify the pain points where possible.

3. Proposed Solution and Scope - What we will do and explicitly what we will not do. Clear boundaries prevent scope creep and set realistic expectations.

4. Deliverables and Milestones - The tangible outputs at each phase. Use a table format showing deliverable, responsible party, and target date.

5. Resource Requirements - People, budget breakdown by category, tools or technology, and any external resources needed. Be specific enough to be credible.

6. Business Case and ROI - The financial justification. Include expected benefits, cost savings, revenue impact, or strategic value. Show the payback period or ROI calculation if applicable.

7. Risk Assessment - Identify the top risks with probability and impact ratings. More importantly, include your mitigation strategy for each.

8. Success Metrics - How we will know this project succeeded. Define two to four measurable KPIs with baseline and target values.

9. Implementation Approach - High-level phases and methodology. Include any key dependencies or prerequisites.

10. Next Steps and Approval Request - What you need from the approvers and by when. Make the ask crystal clear.

Write this proposal to be persuasive yet honest. Use confident, professional language. Include specific numbers and dates rather than vague estimates. Format with clear headings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate. The proposal should demonstrate that you have thoroughly thought through this initiative and are ready to execute.
