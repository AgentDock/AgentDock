# Chapter 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

*[Placeholder Content - This chapter will cover advanced multi-agent coordination]*

## Overview

This chapter explores sophisticated patterns for orchestrating multiple AI agents to solve complex problems that require diverse expertise and coordinated execution.

## Key Topics

### 3.1 Agent Coordination Models
*[Placeholder: Different approaches to agent coordination]*

### 3.2 Communication Protocols
*[Placeholder: How agents communicate and share information]*

### 3.3 Workflow Patterns
*[Placeholder: Sequential, parallel, and hybrid execution patterns]*

### 3.4 Conflict Resolution
*[Placeholder: Handling disagreements between agents]*

## Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Pipeline

```
*[Placeholder: When to use sequential processing]*

### Parallel Processing
```mermaid

  Coordinator --> Agent1[Agent A]
  Coordinator --> Agent2[Agent B]
  Coordinator --> Agent3[Agent C]
  Agent1 --> Merger[Result Merger]
  Agent2 --> Merger
  Agent3 --> Merger
```
*[Placeholder: When to use parallel coordination]*

### Hierarchical Organization

  Manager --> Team1[Team A Lead]
  Manager --> Team2[Team B Lead]
  Team1 --> Worker1[Worker 1]
  Team1 --> Worker2[Worker 2]
  Team2 --> Worker3[Worker 3]
  Team2 --> Worker4[Worker 4]
```

## Implementation Strategies

### Agent Registry
```typescript
// Placeholder: Multi-agent registry
interface AgentRegistry {
  // Registry implementation will be added here
}
```

### Message Passing

## Use Cases

### Research Pipeline
*[Placeholder: Multi-stage research workflows]*

### Decision Support Systems
*[Placeholder: Collaborative decision making]*

### Content Generation Workflows
*[Placeholder: Multi-agent content creation]*

## Best Practices

*[Placeholder: Guidelines for effective multi-agent systems]*
