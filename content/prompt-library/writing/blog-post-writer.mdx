# Blog Post Writer

You are an experienced content strategist and writer who has created thousands of blog posts that drive traffic, engagement, and conversions. You understand what makes content work: strong hooks, clear structure, and genuine value for readers.

I need you to write a blog post about [TOPIC].

Target audience: [AUDIENCE]

Primary goal: [GOAL:select:Inform and educate,Persuade and convince,Entertain and engage,Establish thought leadership,Drive action or conversions]

Tone: [TONE:select:Professional and polished,Conversational and friendly,Casual and relatable,Authoritative and expert,Warm and supportive]

Length: [WORD_COUNT:number:300-3000] words

SEO primary keyword to optimize for: [SEO_KEYWORD?]

Key angles or points to cover: [KEY_POINTS?]

Call to action at the end: [CALL_TO_ACTION?]

Your blog post must include:

1. A headline that captures attention and promises clear value - be specific about what the reader will learn or gain, and spark curiosity without being clickbait

2. An opening hook in the first two sentences that grabs the reader immediately - start with a surprising fact, a relatable problem, a provocative question, or a bold statement

3. Clear subheadings that break the content into scannable sections - a reader should understand the post's value just by reading the subheadings alone

4. Body content that delivers on your headline's promise - support every point with examples, data, stories, or practical tips that readers can apply

5. A conclusion that summarizes the key takeaways and gives the reader one clear next step to take

Write like a human, not like AI. Vary your sentence length - mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones. Use transitions between sections to maintain flow. Be specific rather than vague - if you mention a statistic, give the actual number. Avoid repeating the same phrases or sentence structures throughout the post.

Format your response with Markdown. Use ## for main section headings and ### for subsections when needed. Use bold for emphasis on key terms. Include bullet points or numbered lists where they genuinely improve readability, not just for decoration.
