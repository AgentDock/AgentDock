# Packing List Generator

I need a packing list that makes sure I do not forget anything important for my trip.

I am traveling to [DESTINATION] for [TRIP_LENGTH:select:a weekend (2-3 days),a short trip (4-5 days),one week,10-14 days,longer than two weeks].

The weather and climate will be [CLIMATE:select:hot and sunny,warm and humid,mild and pleasant,cold and chilly,very cold with snow,mixed or unpredictable,tropical with possible rain].

The activities I have planned include [ACTIVITIES] (such as beach, hiking, business meetings, sightseeing, formal dinners, adventure sports, etc.).

I am traveling by [TRAVEL_MODE:select:plane with carry-on only,plane with checked luggage,car or road trip,train,cruise].

Special considerations: [SPECIAL_NEEDS?] (such as medications, baby items, work equipment, photography gear, etc.)

Create a complete packing list organized by category like clothing, toiletries, electronics, documents, and miscellaneous. Include quantities based on my trip length. Mark items that are essential versus nice to have. Include trip-specific items based on my activities and destination. Add a section for things to do before I leave like stopping mail or arranging pet care. If I am doing carry-on only, flag items that might not be allowed or need special packing. Include packing tips for my specific situation.
