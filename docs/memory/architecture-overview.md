## PRIME: Intelligent Memory Extraction

**Purpose**: Transform conversations into structured memories

```mermaid

    A["Raw Message: 'I met Sarah at the coffee shop, she mentioned the project deadline is Friday'"] --> B[PRIME Extraction]
    B --> C[Person: Sarah - Semantic]
    B --> D[Location: coffee shop - Episodic]
    B --> E[Deadline: project due Friday - Procedural]

## Advanced Features

### PRIME Extraction
- **Rule-based guidance**: Natural language extraction rules
- **Tier optimization**: Auto-select model based on complexity
- **Cost intelligence**: Budget tracking with <$20/month for 100k operations

### Memory Retrieval (Enhanced)
- **Vector-first**: Semantic similarity using text-embedding-3-small
- **Hybrid search**: Combines vector (70%) + text (30%) scoring
- **Multi-adapter**: PostgreSQL ts_rank_cd + SQLite FTS5 BM25
- **Performance**: <50ms recall, >95% accuracy
- **Configurable hops**: 1-3 connection hops based on recall preset
- **Temporal boost**: Relevance boost for time-pattern matches
- **Evolution tracking**: Access events logged automatically

## Key Technical Differentiators

**Four-Layer Memory Architecture**: Unlike single-layer systems, AgentDock mirrors human cognition with working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory types, each optimized for different information patterns and retrieval scenarios.

**PRIME Extraction Intelligence**: Intelligent 2-tier model selection with rule-based guidance reduces extraction costs by 60% while maintaining quality. Most systems use expensive models for all extractions.

**Hybrid Vector-Text Search**: Pure vector search fails on specialized terminology. Our research-validated 70/30 vector/text split prevents catastrophic failures while maintaining semantic understanding across domains.

**Memory Connection Graph**: SQL-based graph operations without dedicated graph databases. 5 research-backed connection types (similar, related, causes, part_of, opposite) with intelligent relationship traversal up to 3 hops deep.

**Progressive Enhancement Connection Discovery**: Tiered approach (embeddings â†’ rules â†’ LLM) reduces connection discovery costs by 65% while maintaining quality. Smart triage automatically classifies 65% of connections without LLM calls.

**Automatic Memory Consolidation**: Episodic-to-semantic conversion with merge, synthesize, and hierarchy strategies. Reduces storage while improving recall quality through intelligent memory lifecycle management.

**Lazy Memory Decay System**: On-demand decay calculation with configurable half-lives per memory type. 65-100% write avoidance through batch processing and access reinforcement patterns.

**Temporal Intelligence Integration**: Built-in pattern analysis, time-based memory relationships, and temporal influence on decay/recall. Statistical approach with optional LLM enhancement for behavioral insights.

**Multi-Adapter Architecture**: Single API works with PostgreSQL, SQLite, ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Qdrant without vendor lock-in. Managed service compatibility without database extensions.

**Cost-Optimized Operations**: Built-in budget tracking, smart triage, lazy calculations, and transparent cost reporting. Designed for production deployment with predictable costs under $20/month for 100k operations.

**Production-Ready Persistence**: SQL-based storage with optional vector enhancements. Transaction management, encryption support, and no complex graph database management requirements.

## Intelligence Layer: Advanced Memory Processing

**Purpose**: Enhance memory system with intelligent analysis and connections

### Memory Connections & Graph
- **MemoryConnectionManager**: Language-agnostic connection discovery

- **Smart triage**: 40% auto-similar, 25% auto-related, 35% LLM classification
- **Progressive enhancement**: embeddings â†’ user rules â†’ LLM analysis

### Memory Consolidation
- **MemoryConsolidator**: Convert episodic â†’ semantic memories
- **Strategies**: merge, synthesize, hierarchy
- **Language-agnostic**: Uses embeddings, optional LLM enhancement
- **Batch processing**: Efficient consolidation operations

### Temporal Pattern Analysis (Production Ready)
- **TemporalPatternAnalyzer**: Analyze memory access patterns
- **Pattern detection**: hourly, weekly, burst patterns
- **Activity clusters**: Identify periods of high memory activity
- **Statistical approach**: Optional LLM enhancement
- **Pattern storage**: Results stored in memory metadata as `temporalInsights`
- **Recall boost**: Daily patterns boost relevance during peak hours
- **Decay influence**: Burst patterns slow decay by 30%
- **Connection detection**: Temporal relationships between memories
