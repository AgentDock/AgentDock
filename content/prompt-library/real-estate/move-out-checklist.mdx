# Move-Out Checklist Generator

I am preparing to move out of my rental property and need a comprehensive, organized checklist to ensure I leave in good standing and maximize my chances of getting my full security deposit back. My rental is a [PROPERTY_TYPE:select:studio apartment,one-bedroom apartment,two-bedroom apartment,three-bedroom apartment,house,townhouse,condo,room rental] that I have lived in for [TENANCY_LENGTH:select:less than 6 months,6-12 months,1-2 years,2-5 years,more than 5 years]. My move-out date is approximately [WEEKS_UNTIL_MOVE:select:1-2 weeks away,3-4 weeks away,5-6 weeks away,7-8 weeks away] from now.

My lease requires [NOTICE_PERIOD:select:30 days notice,60 days notice,90 days notice,already given notice,not sure of requirements] before moving out. The property has [FLOORING:select:all carpet,all hardwood,mix of carpet and hardwood,tile throughout,laminate flooring] and includes [APPLIANCES:select:basic appliances only,full appliances including dishwasher,full appliances plus washer/dryer,minimal appliances]. I have pets: [PETS:select:no pets,cat(s),dog(s),cats and dogs,other pets] and I [MODIFICATIONS:select:made no modifications,painted walls,hung items and made holes,made several modifications,made significant modifications] during my tenancy.

My primary concern is [CONCERN:select:maximizing security deposit return,leaving on good terms with landlord,organizing a smooth move,documenting condition to avoid disputes,meeting tight timeline]. The current condition of the property is [CONDITION:select:excellent with minimal wear,good with normal wear,needs some cleaning and repairs,needs significant work].

Please generate a timeline-based move-out checklist that works backward from my move-out date, organizing tasks by when they should be completed. Include notification tasks such as informing my landlord, utility companies, and updating my address with relevant services. Provide a room-by-room cleaning guide with specific tasks for kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, living areas, and any outdoor spaces, with attention to commonly overlooked areas that landlords inspect closely. List minor repairs I should handle myself versus what requires professional help, considering what might be deducted from my deposit. Create a documentation process including photos and video walkthrough guidance to protect myself in case of disputes.

Address the administrative side including utility transfers and cancellations, mail forwarding setup, and notifying banks and subscriptions of my address change. Include preparation steps for the final walkthrough with my landlord, what questions to ask, and what documentation to request. Given my tenancy length and any modifications I made, highlight specific items that may need extra attention or repair before move-out.

Format the checklist with clear timeframes so I can track progress, include estimated time requirements for major tasks, and note any tasks that may require scheduling in advance such as professional cleaning or carpet shampooing. Provide tips specific to my property type and situation that will help me leave the rental in better condition than expected.
