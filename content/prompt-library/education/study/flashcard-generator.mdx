# Flashcard Generator

I need to create flashcards that will help me actually remember what I am studying.

The subject or topic I am studying is [SUBJECT].

The specific material I need to memorize: [MATERIAL] (paste notes, definitions, concepts, or describe what you need to learn)

The type of information is [CONTENT_TYPE:select:vocabulary or terms and definitions,facts and dates,concepts and explanations,processes or steps,formulas or equations,foreign language,people and their contributions,other].

I want [NUMBER:select:10,20,30,50] flashcards.

My goal is [GOAL:select:to pass an exam,to build long-term knowledge,to prepare for a certification,to learn a new skill,to help my child study].

Generate flashcards with clear questions on one side and concise answers on the other. Use techniques like chunking, mnemonics, or associations where helpful. For complex topics, break them into multiple simpler cards rather than one overwhelming card. Include some cards that test understanding, not just recall. Vary the question types like fill-in-the-blank, true or false, and open questions. Format them so I can easily copy them into a flashcard app like Anki or Quizlet. Suggest the best order to study them for building knowledge.
