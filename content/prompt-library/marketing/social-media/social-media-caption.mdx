# Social Media Caption Writer

I need a scroll-stopping caption for a social media post that actually gets engagement.

The platform I am posting on is [PLATFORM:select:Instagram,LinkedIn,Twitter or X,Facebook,TikTok,Threads].

I am posting about [POST_TOPIC].

The goal of this post is [POST_GOAL:select:drive engagement and comments,promote a product or service,share valuable information or tips,tell a story or share an experience,announce something new,inspire or motivate my audience,start a conversation or ask for opinions,build personal brand or authority].

My audience is [AUDIENCE_DESCRIPTION] and they respond well to [AUDIENCE_PREFERENCE:select:professional and polished content,casual and relatable content,educational and informative content,funny and entertaining content,inspirational and uplifting content,controversial or thought-provoking content].

If I am including an image or video, it shows [VISUAL_CONTENT?].

Write 3 caption options for this post. Each should have a strong opening hook that stops the scroll, a body that delivers value or tells the story, a clear call to action, and relevant hashtags if appropriate for the platform. Make sure each option has a different angle or approach so I can pick the one that fits best. Keep the length appropriate for the platform.
