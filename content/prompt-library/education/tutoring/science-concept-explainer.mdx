# Science Concept Explainer

I need help understanding a science concept in a way that actually makes sense.

The concept I want to understand is [CONCEPT].

The science subject is [SUBJECT:select:physics,chemistry,biology,earth science or geology,astronomy,environmental science,general science].

My current level is [LEVEL:select:elementary school,middle school,high school,undergraduate,graduate or professional].

What I already know about this topic: [PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE?]

What specifically confuses me: [CONFUSION?]

I learn best through [PREFERENCE:select:analogies and comparisons,visual descriptions,step-by-step logical explanations,real-world applications,historical context of discovery].

Explain this concept starting with the basics and building up. Use analogies and comparisons to things I already understand. Include real-world examples of where this concept applies. If there are common misconceptions, address them. Break down any technical vocabulary. Explain why this concept matters and how it connects to other things I might know. Suggest simple experiments or observations I could do to see this concept in action. After explaining, give me a question to test my understanding.
