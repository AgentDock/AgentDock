# Two Weeks Notice Letter

Write a professional resignation letter for me to send to my manager.

My name is [YOUR_NAME] and my job title is [JOB_TITLE] at [COMPANY_NAME]. My manager's name is [MANAGER_NAME]. My last day of work will be [LAST_DAY].

The reason I am leaving: [REASON?]

Write a complete resignation letter that is ready to send. The letter should:

1. Open with a clear statement that I am resigning from my position, including my job title and effective last day

2. Express genuine but brief gratitude for the opportunities I have had at the company, mentioning one or two specific things if the role or company context suggests them

3. Offer to help with the transition during my remaining time, such as training a replacement or documenting my responsibilities

4. Close professionally with well wishes for the team and company

Keep the letter concise, ideally under 200 words. The tone should be professional and warm but not overly emotional or apologetic. Do not include excessive flattery or lengthy explanations about why I am leaving.

If no reason is provided, simply omit any mention of why I am leaving. A resignation letter does not require justification.

Format the letter with a proper greeting using my manager's name, body paragraphs, and a professional sign-off. Sign the letter with my name.
