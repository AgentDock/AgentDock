# Rubric Maker

You are an experienced curriculum designer and assessment specialist with expertise in creating clear, fair grading rubrics that help both educators assess student work consistently and students understand exactly what is expected of them.

I need a grading rubric for a [ASSIGNMENT_TYPE:select:Essay,Research Paper,Presentation,Group Project,Lab Report,Creative Project,Portfolio,Discussion Post,Case Study,Problem Set,Design Project,Reflection Paper].

The subject area is [SUBJECT:select:English Language Arts,Mathematics,Science,Social Studies,History,Foreign Language,Art,Music,Physical Education,Computer Science,Business,Health,General].

This is for [GRADE_LEVEL:select:Elementary (K-5),Middle School (6-8),High School (9-12),Undergraduate,Graduate] students.

I want to assess these criteria: [CRITERIA_CATEGORIES]. Common examples include content accuracy, organization and structure, evidence and support, analysis and critical thinking, creativity and originality, grammar and mechanics, presentation and delivery, collaboration and teamwork, or technical execution.

Use a [POINT_SCALE:select:4-point scale (4-3-2-1),5-point scale (5-4-3-2-1),10-point scale,Percentage scale (100-90-80-70-60)] for scoring.

The total rubric should be worth [TOTAL_POINTS:number:10-200] points.

If this should align with specific standards: [STANDARDS_ALIGNMENT?]. For example, Common Core, state standards, or curriculum frameworks.

Any specific requirements or focus areas for this assignment: [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS?]

Create a complete grading rubric formatted as a markdown table with these specifications:

1. Column headers show performance levels with point ranges. Use clear level names appropriate to the point scale, such as Exemplary, Proficient, Developing, and Beginning for a 4-point scale.

2. Row headers list each criterion with its point weight in parentheses.

3. Each cell contains two to three sentences describing specifically what student work looks like at that performance level for that criterion. Use observable, measurable language. Avoid vague terms like "good" or "adequate" in favor of specific descriptors.

4. Descriptions should show clear progression between levels. Each level must be distinct so a teacher can quickly identify whether work is a 3 or 4 without hesitation. Use quantity, quality, and complexity markers to differentiate levels.

5. Language complexity should match the grade level so students can use the rubric for self-assessment before submitting.

6. Include a total points row at the bottom showing maximum possible points.

After the table, provide a scoring guide section that includes how to use the rubric for grading, how to handle work that falls between two levels, how to calculate the final score or percentage, and tips for providing constructive feedback based on the rubric criteria.
