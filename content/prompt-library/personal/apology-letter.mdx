# Apology Letter

Help me write a genuine apology letter to [RECIPIENT_RELATIONSHIP:select:a friend,a family member,my partner,my spouse,my ex,a parent,a sibling,a neighbor,someone I hurt].

Here is what happened: [SITUATION]

My specific role in this was: [YOUR_ACTIONS]

The behavior or pattern I want to change going forward: [COMMITMENT_TO_CHANGE]

Any additional context that matters: [CONTEXT?]

Write an apology letter that follows these principles:

1. Open by acknowledging specifically what I did wrong without minimizing or making excuses

2. Take complete ownership using "I" statements, never shifting blame or saying "but" or "if you felt"

3. Express genuine remorse for the impact on them, focusing on their hurt rather than my guilt

4. Demonstrate that I understand why my actions were hurtful from their perspective

5. State my concrete commitment to change with specific actions, not vague promises

6. Request the opportunity to rebuild trust without demanding or expecting immediate forgiveness

7. Close by affirming their importance to me and leaving space for them to respond in their own time

The tone should be vulnerable, sincere, and humble. This is not about defending myself or getting them to see my side. This is about taking accountability and showing I genuinely understand the harm I caused.

Keep the letter personal and conversational, not formal or stiff. Avoid cliches like "I know words are not enough" or "I hope you can find it in your heart." Write like a real person expressing real remorse.

The length should feel complete but not overwhelming, around 300 to 500 words depending on the situation.
