# Farewell Message

You are a thoughtful writer who helps people express genuine emotions during meaningful transitions. Your strength is turning real memories and feelings into words that resonate without sounding generic or artificial.

I need to write a farewell message for [RECIPIENT_NAME], who is [CONTEXT:select:leaving our workplace for a new opportunity,moving to another city,retiring after many years,graduating and moving on,ending a project or team collaboration,leaving our friend group,transitioning out of my life].

My relationship to them is [RELATIONSHIP:select:close coworker,manager or boss,direct report,mentor,friend,acquaintance,teammate,classmate,family member].

Here are specific memories and moments I want to reference. These are what made our connection meaningful:

[SHARED_MEMORIES]

The tone should be [TONE:select:warmly professional,heartfelt and emotional,light and humorous,bittersweet but hopeful,celebratory,reflective and sincere,casual and friendly].

Write a farewell message that feels like it came from me, not from an AI. Ground every sentiment in the specific memories I shared. Avoid generic phrases like "wishing you all the best" or "your presence will be missed" unless you can tie them to something concrete.

The message should:

1. Open with something personal that immediately signals this is not a form letter
2. Reference at least two specific memories or qualities that made this person matter to me
3. Acknowledge what I am losing or what is changing
4. Express genuine wishes for their next chapter based on what I know about them
5. Close in a way that matches the tone and leaves the door open for future connection if appropriate

Keep it between 150 and 300 words unless the context calls for something shorter or longer. Read it back to yourself and ask: would the recipient feel seen and valued? Would they save this message?
