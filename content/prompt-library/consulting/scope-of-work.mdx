# Scope of Work Generator

You are an experienced project manager and consultant who has drafted hundreds of scope of work documents for engagements across industries. You understand that a well-crafted SOW prevents scope creep, aligns expectations between parties, and serves as the operational foundation for successful project delivery. Your scope documents are known for being comprehensive yet clear, protecting both the service provider and client while remaining practical to execute.

I need you to create a scope of work document for a [PROJECT_TYPE:select:Consulting Engagement,Software Development,Web Design,Marketing Campaign,Content Creation,Research Study,Training Program,System Implementation,Process Improvement,Creative Services,Strategic Advisory,Technical Assessment] project.

The service provider is [PROVIDER_NAME] and the client organization is [CLIENT_NAME] in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Financial Services,Manufacturing,Retail,Professional Services,Energy,Real Estate,Education,Government,Nonprofit,Media,Legal,Construction] industry. The primary contact on the client side is [CLIENT_CONTACT] with the title of [CLIENT_TITLE].

Here is the background context and reason this project is being undertaken:

[PROJECT_BACKGROUND]

The specific objectives this project aims to achieve are:

[PROJECT_OBJECTIVES]

The tangible deliverables the client will receive include:

[DELIVERABLES]

The project will begin on [START_DATE] and conclude on [END_DATE], spanning a total duration of [DURATION:select:1-2 weeks,2-4 weeks,1-2 months,2-3 months,3-6 months,6-12 months,12+ months].

Key milestones and checkpoints along the way include: [MILESTONES?]

The total project investment is [TOTAL_FEE] with a payment structure of [PAYMENT_STRUCTURE:select:50% upfront and 50% on completion,Monthly retainer,Milestone-based payments,Net 30 on invoices,Custom payment schedule]. Additional details about payment terms include: [PAYMENT_DETAILS?]

Items explicitly excluded from this scope include: [EXCLUSIONS?]

Assumptions that must hold true for successful delivery include: [ASSUMPTIONS?]

The team members and their roles for this project are: [TEAM_ROLES?]

Write a complete scope of work document that opens with an overview section summarizing the engagement in two to three paragraphs, establishing the parties involved, the purpose of the project, and the business problem or opportunity being addressed.

Follow with a section defining clear and measurable objectives. Each objective should be specific enough that both parties can agree whether it has been achieved. Connect these objectives to the business outcomes the client cares about.

Create a comprehensive deliverables section that lists every tangible output the client will receive. For each deliverable, describe its format, content, and the date by which it will be provided. Be specific enough that there is no ambiguity about what constitutes completion.

Include a detailed timeline showing the project phases, key milestones, dependencies, and decision points. Note any dates that require client input or approval before work can proceed. Account for reasonable review cycles.

Document all assumptions and dependencies that must hold true for the project to succeed. These typically include client availability, access to information or systems, timely feedback, and decision-making authority.

Add an exclusions section that explicitly states what is not included in this engagement. This is critical for preventing scope creep. Be direct about boundaries even if they seem obvious.

Define the roles and responsibilities for both the provider team and the client team. Specify who owns decisions, who provides approvals, and what level of client participation is required.

Include a change management section explaining the process for handling scope changes. State that any additions or modifications must be documented in writing, assessed for impact on timeline and budget, and approved before work begins.

Cover the investment and payment terms including total fees, payment schedule, expense policies, and invoicing procedures. Note any conditions that could affect pricing such as delays caused by the client.

Close with an acceptance section that explains how deliverables will be reviewed and approved, what constitutes formal acceptance, and the timeline for providing feedback.

Write in clear, professional language appropriate for a binding project document. Avoid vague terms like reasonable, timely, or as needed without defining them. Every commitment should be specific enough to be enforceable. Use second person to address the client directly where appropriate.

Format the document with clear section headings and use bullet points or numbered lists for deliverables, milestones, and responsibilities. Keep the total length appropriate to the project complexity, typically between three and ten pages.
