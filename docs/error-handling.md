# Error Handling in AgentDock

This document outlines our approach to error handling in the AgentDock application using React ErrorBoundary components.

## Current Implementation

We use a comprehensive ErrorBoundary component located at `src/components/error-boundary.tsx` that provides robust error handling throughout the application. This component:

1. Catches and handles errors in React component trees
2. Provides a consistent error UI experience throughout the application
3. Includes special handling for different error types (NetworkError, SecurityError, ValidationError, StorageError)
4. Shows detailed error information in development mode
5. Provides retry functionality to recover from errors when possible

## Using the ErrorBoundary

When implementing new features that need error handling:

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "@/components/error-boundary";

// Basic usage
<ErrorBoundary>
  <YourComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>

// With custom fallback UI
<ErrorBoundary
  fallback={<YourCustomErrorComponent />}
>
  <YourComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>

// With error callback
<ErrorBoundary
  onError={(error, errorInfo) => {
    // Log or handle the error
    console.error("Component error:", error);
  }}
  resetOnPropsChange={true}
>
  <YourComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Best Practices

1. Wrap top-level feature components with ErrorBoundary
2. Use specific error types when throwing errors to enable specialized handling
3. Consider using resetOnPropsChange for components that should retry on prop changes
4. Provide meaningful error messages to help users understand what went wrong
5. Keep all error boundary files under 300 lines for maintainability

## Specialized Error Handling

The ErrorBoundary component provides specialized handling for different types of errors:

### Network Errors
- Displays connectivity-related information
- Provides reload options
- Shows troubleshooting tips

### Security Errors
- Handles permission-related issues
- Provides clear guidance on fixing permissions

### Validation Errors
- Shows detailed information about data validation failures
- Provides guidance on fixing input data

### Storage Errors
- Handles issues with browser storage
- Suggests clearing cache or using a different browser

## Future Roadmap

### 1. Error Tracking and Analytics
- Implement integration with error tracking services
- Add anonymous error reporting to improve the application
- Create an error dashboard for administrators

### 2. Enhanced Recovery Strategies
- Implement more sophisticated retry mechanisms
- Add circuit breaker patterns for external services
- Provide user-controlled recovery options

### 3. Context-Aware Error Boundaries
- Create specialized error boundaries for different parts of the application
- Implement context-aware error handling based on component type
- Add custom recovery strategies for specific errors

## Conclusion

Our current error handling approach provides a robust foundation for handling errors consistently across the application. The ErrorBoundary component is designed to be reusable and extensible, making it easy to implement error handling in new features. 

By following the best practices outlined in this document and implementing the future roadmap, we will continue to improve the error handling capabilities of AgentDock, providing a better user experience and making the application more resilient to failures.
