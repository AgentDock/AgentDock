# Daily Journal Prompt Generator

I want to build a consistent journaling habit and need thought-provoking prompts that help me reflect meaningfully.

Today I am feeling [CURRENT_MOOD:select:good and want to build on it,stressed or overwhelmed,stuck or uninspired,grateful and reflective,anxious or worried,neutral and just want to check in,excited about something,sad or processing difficult emotions].

I would like to focus my journaling on [FOCUS_AREA:select:gratitude and appreciation,goals and future planning,processing my emotions,relationships and connections,personal growth and self-improvement,creativity and ideas,work and career,general self-reflection].

Right now in my life I am [LIFE_SITUATION:select:in a period of change or transition,dealing with a challenge or setback,celebrating a win or milestone,in a comfortable routine,starting something new,ending or letting go of something,feeling uncertain about the future,working toward a specific goal].

I prefer journal prompts that are [DEPTH:select:quick and light for a 5-minute session,moderately deep for 10-15 minutes of writing,deeply introspective for longer reflection].

Generate 5 unique journal prompts tailored to how I am feeling and what I want to explore. Make sure the prompts are specific enough to spark real reflection rather than generic questions I could find anywhere. Include at least one prompt that challenges me to think differently and one that encourages self-compassion. After the prompts, suggest one small action I could take today based on my focus area.
