# TikTok Script Writer

I need a TikTok script that captures attention and keeps viewers watching until the end.

The video topic is [TOPIC].

The type of content is [CONTENT_TYPE:select:educational or how-to,storytelling or personal story,trend participation,product review or demo,day in the life,before and after or transformation,hot take or opinion,comedy or skit,listicle or tips,duet or stitch response].

The target length is [LENGTH:select:15 seconds,30 seconds,60 seconds,up to 3 minutes].

My target audience is [AUDIENCE].

The hook style I want: [HOOK_STYLE:select:controversial statement,question that creates curiosity,surprising fact,relatable problem,pattern interrupt,bold claim,trending sound reference].

Key points or information to include: [KEY_POINTS]

My personality or brand voice is [VOICE:select:funny and entertaining,educational and helpful,authentic and relatable,energetic and hype,calm and soothing,sarcastic and witty,professional but approachable].

Trending sound or format to use: [TREND?]

Call to action at the end: [CTA:select:follow for more,comment your thoughts,save this for later,share with someone,link in bio,none just entertainment]

Write a complete TikTok script with the hook in the first 1 to 2 seconds, the main content body, and a strong ending with the call to action. Include notes on delivery and pacing. Note where to pause for effect or add text overlays. The hook must immediately grab attention. Write in a conversational speaking style, not written style. Keep the energy appropriate for TikTok.
