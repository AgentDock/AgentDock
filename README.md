AgentDock is a framework for building sophisticated AI agents that deliver complex tasks with **configurable determinism**. It consists of two main components:

1. **AgentDock Core**: An open-source, backend-first framework for building and deploying AI agents. It's designed to be *framework-agnostic* and *provider-independent*, giving you complete control over your agent's implementation.

2. **Open Source Client**: A complete Next.js application that serves as a reference implementation and consumer of the AgentDock Core framework. You can see it in action at [https://hub.agentdock.ai](https://hub.agentdock.ai)

Built with TypeScript, AgentDock emphasizes *simplicity*, *extensibility*, and ***configurable determinism*** - making it ideal for building reliable and predictable AI systems that can operate with minimal supervision.

## üß† Design Principles

AgentDock is built on these core principles:

- **Simplicity First**: Minimal code required to create functional agents
- **Node-Based Architecture**: All capabilities implemented as nodes
- **Tools as Specialized Nodes**: Tools extend the node system for agent capabilities
- **Configurable Determinism**: Control the predictability of agent behavior
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout

### Configurable Determinism

***Configurable determinism*** is a cornerstone of AgentDock's design philosophy, enabling you to balance creative AI capabilities with predictable system behavior:

- AgentNodes are inherently non-deterministic as LLMs may generate different responses each time
- Workflows can be made more deterministic through *defined tool execution paths*
- Developers can **control the level of determinism** by configuring which parts of the system use LLM inference
- Even with LLM components, the overall system behavior remains **predictable** through structured tool interactions
- This balanced approach enables both *creativity* and **reliability** in your AI applications

#### Deterministic Workflows

AgentDock fully supports the deterministic workflows you're familiar with from typical workflow builders. All the predictable execution paths and reliable outcomes you expect are available, with or without LLM inference:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Input[Input] --> Process[Process]
  Process --> Database[(Database)]
  Process --> Output[Output]

  style Process fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Database fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Non-Deterministic Agent Behavior

With AgentDock, you can also leverage AgentNodes with LLMs when you need more adaptability. The creative outputs may vary based on your needs, while maintaining structured interaction patterns:

```mermaid

  style ToolC fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Response fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Non-Deterministic Agents with Deterministic Sub-Workflows

AgentDock gives you the ***best of both worlds*** by combining non-deterministic agent intelligence with deterministic workflow execution:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Input[User Query] --> Agent[AgentNode]
  Agent -->|"LLM Reasoning (Non-Deterministic)"| FlowChoice{Sub-Workflow Selection}
  FlowChoice -->|"Decision A"| Flow1[Deterministic Workflow 1]

  FlowChoice -->|"Decision C"| DirectResponse[Generate Response]
  
  Flow1 --> |"Step 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí 200"| Flow1Result[Workflow 1 Result]
  Flow2 --> |"Step 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí 100"| Flow2Result[Workflow 2 Result]
  
  Flow1Result --> Response[Final Response]
  Flow2Result --> Response
  DirectResponse --> Response
  
  style Input fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Agent fill:#ffdfba,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style FlowChoice fill:#ffdfba,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Flow1 fill:#c9e4ca,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Flow2 fill:#c9e4ca,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Flow1Result fill:#c9e4ca,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Flow2Result fill:#c9e4ca,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style DirectResponse fill:#ffdfba,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
  style Response fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

This approach enables complex multi-step workflows (potentially involving hundreds of deterministic steps implemented within tools or as connected node sequences) to be invoked by intelligent agent decisions. Each workflow executes predictably despite being triggered by non-deterministic agent reasoning.

For more advanced AI agent workflows and multi-stage processing pipelines, we're building [AgentDock Pro](docs/agentdock-pro.md) - a powerful platform for creating, visualizing, and running complex agent systems.

#### TL;DR on Configurable Determinism 

Think of it like driving. Sometimes you need the AI's creativity (like navigating city streets - non-deterministic), and sometimes you need reliable, step-by-step processes (like following highway signs - deterministic). AgentDock lets you build systems that use *both*, choosing the right approach for each part of a task. You get the AI's smarts *and* predictable results where needed.


## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

The framework is built around a powerful, modular node-based system, serving as the foundation for all agent functionality. This architecture uses distinct node types as building blocks:

-   **`BaseNode`**: The fundamental class establishing the core interface and capabilities for all nodes.
-   **`AgentNode`**: A specialized core node orchestrating LLM interactions, tool usage, and agent logic.
-   **Tools & Custom Nodes**: Developers implement agent capabilities and custom logic as nodes extending `BaseNode`.

These nodes interact through managed registries and can be connected (leveraging the core architecture's ports and potential message bus) to enable complex, configurable, and potentially deterministic agent behaviors and workflows.

For a detailed explanation of the node system's components and capabilities, please see the [Node System Documentation](docs/nodes/README.md).

## üöÄ Getting Started

For a comprehensive guide, see the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

### Requirements

* Node.js ‚â• 20.11.0 (LTS)
* pnpm ‚â• 9.15.0 (Required)
* API keys for LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock.git
   cd AgentDock
   ```

2. **Install pnpm**:

   ```bash
   corepack enable

   For a clean reinstallation (when you need to rebuild from scratch):
   ```bash
   pnpm run clean-install
   ```
   This script removes all node_modules, lock files, and reinstalls dependencies correctly.

4. **Configure Environment**:
   
   Create an environment file (`.env` or `.env.local`) based on `.env.example`:
   
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Create .env.local
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Option 2: Create .env
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then add your API keys to the environment file.

5. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## üîê Environment Configuration Details

The AgentDock Open Source Client requires API keys for LLM providers to function. These are configured in an environment file (`.env` or `.env.local`) which you create based on the provided `.env.example` file.

### LLM Provider API Keys

Add your LLM provider API keys (at least one is required):

```bash
# LLM Provider API Keys - at least one is required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxx  # Anthropic API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx         # OpenAI API key
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxxxx            # Google Gemini API key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=xxxxxxx          # DeepSeek API key
GROQ_API_KEY=xxxxxxx              # Groq API key
```

### API Key Resolution

The AgentDock Open Source Client follows a priority order when resolving which API key to use:

1. **Per-agent custom API key** (set via agent settings in the UI)
2. **Global settings API key** (set via the settings page in the UI)
3. **Environment variable** (from .env.local or deployment platform)

### Tool-specific API Keys

Some tools also require their own API keys:

```bash
# Tool-specific API Keys
SERPER_API_KEY=                  # Required for search functionality
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=               # Required for deeper web search
```

For more details about environment configuration, see the implementation in [`src/types/env.ts`](src/types/env.ts).

### Using Your Own API Keys (BYOK)

AgentDock follows a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model:

1. Add your API keys in the settings page of the application
2. Alternatively, provide keys via request headers for direct API usage
3. Keys are securely stored using the built-in encryption system
4. No API keys are shared or stored on our servers
