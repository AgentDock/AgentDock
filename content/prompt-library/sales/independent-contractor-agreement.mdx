# Independent Contractor Agreement Generator

I need to create an independent contractor agreement for a business relationship. Please draft a professional contract based on the following details.

The hiring party is [COMPANY_NAME], a [COMPANY_TYPE:select:sole proprietorship,LLC,corporation,partnership,nonprofit] located in [COMPANY_STATE_PROVINCE] with a primary contact of [COMPANY_CONTACT_NAME] at [COMPANY_EMAIL].

For compensation, the payment structure is [PAYMENT_TYPE:select:fixed project fee,hourly rate,monthly retainer,milestone-based payments] with the amount being [PAYMENT_AMOUNT] in [CURRENCY:select:USD,EUR,GBP,CAD,AUD,other]. Invoices will be submitted [INVOICE_FREQUENCY:select:upon completion,weekly,bi-weekly,monthly,per milestone] and payment is due within [PAYMENT_TERMS:select:upon receipt,net 15,net 30,net 45,net 60] days. Expenses [EXPENSE_POLICY:select:are not reimbursable,require pre-approval over a threshold,are fully reimbursable with receipts].

Regarding intellectual property, [IP_OWNERSHIP:select:all work product becomes company property (work-for-hire),contractor retains ownership and grants company a perpetual license,company owns final deliverables but contractor retains rights to pre-existing materials and general knowledge,ownership transfers upon final payment]. The contractor [PORTFOLIO_RIGHTS:select:may use work samples in their portfolio with client approval,may use anonymized work samples,may not display or reference the work publicly].

For confidentiality, the contractor agrees to protect proprietary information for [CONFIDENTIALITY_PERIOD:select:the duration of the agreement only,one year after termination,two years after termination,three years after termination,indefinitely]. The agreement [NON_COMPETE:select:does not include non-compete restrictions,includes non-compete for direct competitors during the term,includes non-compete for 6 months after termination,includes non-compete for 12 months after termination] and [NON_SOLICIT:select:does not include non-solicitation,includes non-solicitation of employees for 12 months,includes non-solicitation of clients and employees for 12 months].

The agreement starts on [START_DATE] with a term of [CONTRACT_TERM:select:project completion (no fixed end date),30 days,90 days,6 months,1 year,ongoing until terminated]. Either party may terminate [TERMINATION_NOTICE:select:immediately for cause only,with 7 days written notice,with 14 days written notice,with 30 days written notice]. Upon termination, [TERMINATION_PAYMENT:select:payment is due only for completed work,payment is due for completed work plus approved expenses,a kill fee of 25% of remaining contract value applies,a kill fee of 50% of remaining contract value applies].

This agreement is governed by the laws of [GOVERNING_LAW_JURISDICTION] and disputes will be resolved through [DISPUTE_RESOLUTION:select:negotiation then litigation in state courts,binding arbitration,mediation then arbitration,mediation then litigation].

Please structure the agreement with clear sections for each major topic, use plain language where possible while maintaining legal precision, and include signature blocks for both parties. Include a statement clarifying the contractor's independent status and that this relationship does not create an employer-employee relationship.

Important: This generated agreement is a starting point and template only. Laws governing independent contractor relationships vary significantly by jurisdiction and may have specific requirements regarding worker classification, tax obligations, and enforceable terms. I understand this should be reviewed and customized by a qualified attorney licensed in the relevant jurisdiction before use in any actual business relationship.
