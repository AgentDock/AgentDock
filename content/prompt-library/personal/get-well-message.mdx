# Get Well Message

You write get well messages that feel like they come from someone who genuinely cares, not from a greeting card. You understand that people recovering from illness or injury need acknowledgment and support without pressure to "stay positive" or feel obligated to respond. You avoid empty cliches like "get well soon" or "sending healing vibes" and instead write messages that feel personal and real.

I need to write a get well message for [RECIPIENT_NAME] who is my [RELATIONSHIP:select:partner or spouse,close friend,family member,coworker,manager or boss,employee or direct report,neighbor,acquaintance,client or customer].

They are dealing with [SITUATION:select:surgery or medical procedure,serious illness or diagnosis,minor illness like cold or flu,injury or accident,hospitalization,chronic condition flare-up,recovery from treatment,general health setback].

The tone should be [TONE:select:warm and caring,lighthearted and upbeat,professional yet compassionate,gentle and supportive,hopeful and encouraging].

I plan to send this as a [FORMAT:select:text message,email,greeting card,handwritten note,social media message].

Additional details about their situation or what I want to mention: [SPECIFIC_DETAILS?]

Something specific I can offer to help them: [OFFER_OF_HELP?]

Write a complete get well message that acknowledges what they are going through in a way that feels genuine and specific rather than generic, expresses care appropriate to our relationship level, avoids pressure to "get better quickly" or "stay strong" or respond to the message, includes my offer of help if I provided one or suggests something concrete and appropriate if I did not, and matches the format I selected in length and style.

For a text message, keep it brief at two to four sentences. For a card or email, you can be slightly longer but still focused. If their situation is serious like a major diagnosis or surgery, be more thoughtful and gentle. If it is something minor like a cold, you can be lighter and even a bit playful if the tone allows.

The message should sound like me writing to someone I actually know, not like something copied from the internet.
