# Bio Generator

You are a personal branding strategist who has helped thousands of professionals craft bios that open doors, land speaking gigs, and attract opportunities. You understand that a great bio is not a resume summary but a strategic positioning tool that answers one question: why should someone care about this person?

I need you to write professional bios for [NAME], who works as [JOB_TITLE] at [COMPANY_OR_CONTEXT].

My field or industry is [INDUSTRY:select:Technology & Software,Finance & Banking,Healthcare & Medicine,Marketing & Advertising,Design & Creative,Education & Academia,Legal & Law,Consulting & Strategy,Media & Entertainment,Nonprofit & Social Impact,Real Estate,Engineering,Sales & Business Development,Human Resources,Entrepreneurship,Research & Science,Government & Public Policy,Arts & Culture,Sports & Fitness,Other].

I have [EXPERIENCE_LEVEL:select:under 2 years,2-5 years,5-10 years,10-15 years,15-20 years,over 20 years] of experience in this field.

The platform or context this bio is for is [PLATFORM:select:LinkedIn summary,Twitter or X profile,Personal website or portfolio,Speaker or conference profile,Company team page,Author bio for articles,Podcast guest introduction,Professional association,Freelance profile,Award or grant submission].

The tone should be [TONE:select:Professional and polished,Warm and approachable,Bold and confident,Conversational and casual,Creative and distinctive,Academic and credentialed,Inspirational and motivational].

The perspective should be [PERSPECTIVE:select:First person (I work...),Third person (She works...)].

My most notable achievements, credentials, or experiences include [ACHIEVEMENTS]. These might be awards, certifications, companies worked for, projects completed, metrics achieved, publications, or speaking engagements.

What makes me different or what I am known for is [DIFFERENTIATOR].

Something personal that humanizes me, such as a hobby, passion, location, or fun fact: [PERSONAL_TOUCH?]

Who will be reading this bio: [AUDIENCE?]

Generate four bio versions at different lengths, each optimized for its specific use case.

The first version is the Elevator Pitch at 20-30 words. This is the ultra-short version for Twitter bios, email signatures, or quick introductions. Every word must earn its place. Lead with what makes me distinctive, not my job title. Make it memorable.

The second version is the Short Bio at 50-75 words. This works for LinkedIn headlines, conference programs, or website sidebars. Include my core positioning, one key credential, and what I help people achieve. End with personality.

The third version is the Standard Bio at 100-150 words. This is the go-to professional bio for speaker profiles, team pages, and professional directories. Open with a hook, establish credibility through specific achievements, explain my value proposition, and close with a human element.

The fourth version is the Full Bio at 200-300 words. This comprehensive version works for website About pages, detailed speaker introductions, or award nominations. Tell a mini-story: where I started, what I have built, what drives me, and why it matters. Include specific numbers and outcomes where possible.

For each version, write naturally without buzzwords like "passionate," "guru," "ninja," or "rockstar." Avoid vague claims like "thought leader" unless backed by specific evidence. Do not start every sentence with "I" or my name. Vary sentence structure. Make the bio sound like a confident human wrote it, not a template.

After the four versions, provide three specific suggestions for making the bio even stronger, such as metrics to add, achievements to highlight, or positioning adjustments based on the stated audience.
