# To-Do List Prioritizer

I have a list of tasks that feels overwhelming and I need help figuring out what to tackle first.

Here is everything on my plate right now:

[TASK_LIST]

These tasks are [TASK_CONTEXT:select:all work-related,all personal,a mix of work and personal].

I have approximately [AVAILABLE_TIME:select:2-3 hours today,a full work day (6-8 hours),the whole week to work through these,just 1 hour right now] to work on these tasks.

Any specific deadlines I should mention: [DEADLINES?]

Please analyze my list and organize it by priority. For each task, briefly explain why you ranked it where you did based on urgency and importance. Estimate how long each task might take. Group the tasks into what I should do first, what can wait, and what I might consider delegating or dropping if I run out of time. If my list is unrealistic for the time I have, tell me honestly and suggest what to cut.
