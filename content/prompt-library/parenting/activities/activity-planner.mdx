# Activity Planner (Age-Based)

I need activity ideas to keep kids engaged and entertained.

The age of the child or children is [CHILD_AGE:select:infant 0-1,toddler 1-3,preschool 3-5,early elementary 5-8,older elementary 8-11,preteen 11-13,mixed ages].

The setting is [SETTING:select:at home indoors,backyard or outdoor at home,at a park,on a road trip,at a restaurant waiting,rainy day stuck inside,playdate with friends,family gathering].

Time available for the activity: [TIME_AVAILABLE:select:15-30 minutes quick activity,1 hour,2-3 hours,half day,full day].

The activity type I am looking for: [ACTIVITY_TYPE:select:active and physical,creative and artistic,educational and learning,calm and quiet,screen-free,group activity,independent play,parent-child bonding].

Materials or supplies I have available: [MATERIALS?]

Any themes or interests the child has: [INTERESTS?]

Budget for supplies: [BUDGET:select:no cost use what we have,low cost under $10,moderate up to $25,flexible].

Suggest several activity ideas that are developmentally appropriate for the age, match our setting and time constraints, require materials we have or can easily get, and balance fun with some learning or skill building. For each activity include what we need, how to do it, and tips for success.
