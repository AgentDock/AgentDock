# Symptom Research Assistant

I want to research my symptoms so I can have an informed conversation with my doctor. I understand this is not medical advice and I should consult a healthcare professional.

The symptoms I am experiencing are [SYMPTOMS].

These symptoms started [ONSET:select:today or very recently,a few days ago,about a week ago,a few weeks ago,a month or more ago] and they are [PATTERN:select:constant and unchanging,coming and going,getting worse over time,getting better over time,triggered by specific things].

On a scale of impact, these symptoms are [SEVERITY:select:mild - noticeable but not limiting my activities,moderate - somewhat affecting my daily life,severe - significantly impacting my ability to function,very severe - I cannot do normal activities].

Other relevant information: [CONTEXT?] (such as recent changes in diet, medications, stress, travel, exposure to illness, etc.)

Help me prepare for a doctor visit by explaining what these symptoms might generally indicate in plain language. List questions I should ask my doctor. Suggest what information I should bring to the appointment like timing, triggers, and what makes it better or worse. Explain when these symptoms would warrant urgent care versus a regular appointment. Organize my symptoms in a clear way I can communicate to my healthcare provider. Remind me of the limitations of online symptom research and the importance of professional medical evaluation.
