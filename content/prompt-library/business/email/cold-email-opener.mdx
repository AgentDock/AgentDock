# Cold Email Opener Generator

I need attention-grabbing opening lines for a cold email that will make the recipient want to keep reading instead of hitting delete.

The recipient is [RECIPIENT_NAME] who works as [RECIPIENT_ROLE] at [RECIPIENT_COMPANY].

Here is something specific I know about them that I can reference: [SPECIFIC_CONTEXT] (such as a recent accomplishment, content they published, company news, mutual connection, or something I genuinely noticed about their work)

The ultimate goal of my email is [EMAIL_GOAL:select:book a meeting,start a conversation,get a referral,pitch a partnership,offer my services,share something valuable,request informational interview].

Generate [NUMBER_OF_VARIATIONS:number:3-8] different opening line variations using different psychological approaches. Include at least one of each style: a personalized compliment opener, a trigger event or news reference opener, and a direct value proposition opener.

For each opener, write only 1-2 sentences maximum. Label the approach used for each one. Make sure none of them start with generic phrases like "Hope this finds you well" or "I know you're busy" - those get emails deleted instantly. Each opener should feel specific to this person, not like it could be sent to anyone.
