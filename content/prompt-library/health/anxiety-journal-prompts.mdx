# Anxiety Journal Prompts Generator

I want you to generate personalized journal prompts to help me work through anxiety. These prompts should be informed by cognitive behavioral therapy principles while remaining accessible for self-guided journaling.

The type of anxiety I most frequently experience is [ANXIETY_TYPE:select:general worry and overthinking,social anxiety and fear of judgment,health anxiety and bodily concerns,work or performance anxiety,future uncertainty and catastrophizing,past events and rumination,relationship anxiety,a mix of several types]. The intensity of my anxiety lately has been [INTENSITY:select:mild - present but manageable,moderate - noticeable impact on daily life,high - significantly affecting my functioning,variable - fluctuates throughout the day or week].

Right now, my primary anxiety trigger or concern is [CURRENT_CONCERN]. Describe the specific situation, thought pattern, or area of life that is causing you the most distress at this moment.

My experience with journaling is [EXPERIENCE:select:completely new to journaling,tried it a few times but never stuck with it,journal occasionally when stressed,regular journaler looking for better prompts,experienced with therapeutic writing]. The time I can realistically commit to journaling is [TIME:select:5 minutes or less,5 to 10 minutes,10 to 20 minutes,as long as it takes - no time limit].

I respond best to [APPROACH:select:gentle and compassionate prompts,direct and practical questions,a mix of emotional exploration and action steps,analytical and logical approaches,creative or metaphorical prompts]. Any coping strategies that have helped me in the past include [PAST_STRATEGIES?]. Optional. Share what has worked for you before, such as breathing exercises, talking to someone, physical activity, or specific thought patterns.

Please generate a set of journal prompts for me that includes the following elements in this order.

First, provide two grounding prompts that help me connect with the present moment and notice what I am actually experiencing in my body and surroundings without judgment. These should help me step back from the spiral of anxious thoughts.

Second, provide two cognitive reframing prompts that guide me to examine the thoughts driving my anxiety. Help me distinguish between facts and interpretations, challenge catastrophic predictions, and consider alternative perspectives without dismissing my feelings.

Third, provide one action prompt that identifies a small, doable step I could take today to either address the source of my anxiety or practice tolerating uncertainty. This should feel achievable, not overwhelming.

Fourth, provide one self-compassion prompt that helps me acknowledge the difficulty of what I am experiencing and respond to myself with the same kindness I would offer a friend.

After the prompts, include a brief note on how to use them effectively, such as choosing one or two per session rather than all at once, and why writing by hand or typing freely without editing can deepen the benefit.

These prompts are for personal self-reflection and emotional processing. They are not a substitute for professional mental health treatment. If you are experiencing severe anxiety, panic attacks, or thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a licensed mental health professional or crisis service. Journaling works best as a complement to professional support, not a replacement for it.
