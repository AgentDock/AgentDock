# Value Proposition Generator

You are a positioning strategist who has helped hundreds of companies from startups to Fortune 500s craft value propositions that convert. You understand that a great value proposition is not about what a company does but about the transformation it creates for customers.

I need you to create a compelling value proposition for my business.

My company or product is called [COMPANY_OR_PRODUCT_NAME] and we operate in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,E-commerce,Education,Professional Services,Manufacturing,Real Estate,Food & Beverage,Fitness & Wellness,Travel & Hospitality,Media & Entertainment,Nonprofit,B2B SaaS,Consumer Products] space.

My target customer is [TARGET_CUSTOMER_DESCRIPTION]. The main problem they face is [CORE_PROBLEM_OR_PAIN_POINT]. Without a solution, this problem costs them [CONSEQUENCE_OF_INACTION] in terms of time, money, or opportunity.

My solution addresses this by [HOW_YOUR_SOLUTION_WORKS]. The primary benefit customers get is [PRIMARY_BENEFIT]. Secondary benefits include [SECONDARY_BENEFITS?].

Compared to alternatives like [COMPETITOR_OR_ALTERNATIVE_SOLUTIONS], my key differentiators are [UNIQUE_DIFFERENTIATORS]. Evidence supporting my claims includes [PROOF_POINTS?] such as customer count, revenue impact, time saved, satisfaction scores, testimonials, case studies, awards, or third-party ratings.

The tone should be [TONE:select:Professional and authoritative,Friendly and approachable,Bold and confident,Technical and precise,Warm and empathetic,Innovative and forward-thinking].

Generate a complete value proposition package with these components:

1. **The One-Liner** - A single sentence under 15 words that captures the core value. This goes in email signatures, social bios, and elevator introductions.

2. **The Elevator Pitch** - A 30-second version (roughly 75 words) that explains who you help, what problem you solve, and why you are different. Natural enough to speak out loud.

3. **Website Hero Copy** - Headline (under 10 words), subheadline (under 25 words), and three bullet points highlighting key benefits. Ready to paste into a landing page.

4. **The Positioning Statement** - Following the classic format: "For [target customer] who [need/opportunity], [product name] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [key differentiator]."

5. **The Before/After Transformation** - A two-column comparison showing the customer's situation before using your solution versus after. Include emotional and practical dimensions.

For each component, focus on outcomes over features. Use concrete language and specific numbers where possible. Avoid jargon unless your target customer uses that terminology. Make every word earn its place.

After generating all five components, provide a brief analysis of:
- Which version works best for which context (sales calls, website, pitch deck, ads)
- One suggestion for strengthening the differentiation
- Any gaps in the positioning that might need more customer research
