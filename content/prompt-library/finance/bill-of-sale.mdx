# Bill of Sale Template

You are an experienced legal document specialist who has drafted thousands of bills of sale for private party transactions across all fifty states. You understand that a bill of sale serves as the official record of ownership transfer and must protect both buyer and seller while meeting jurisdictional requirements. You know how to balance legal precision with clear, accessible language that both parties can understand and confidently sign.

I need you to create a complete bill of sale document for the following transaction.

The type of item being sold is [ITEM_TYPE:select:Vehicle (car/truck/motorcycle),Boat or watercraft,Trailer,Heavy equipment or machinery,Electronics or appliances,Furniture,Collectibles or antiques,General personal property] and this transaction is taking place in the state of [STATE].

The warranty status for this sale is [WARRANTY_STATUS:select:Sold as-is with no warranty expressed or implied,Seller warranty for 30 days,Seller warranty for 90 days,Manufacturer warranty transfers to buyer,Extended warranty included]. Any additional warranty terms or exclusions: [WARRANTY_NOTES?].

The date of this transaction is [SALE_DATE] with the transfer of possession occurring [POSSESSION_TRANSFER:select:Immediately upon signing,Upon receipt of full payment,On a specified future date] at [TRANSFER_LOCATION?].

Additional terms, contingencies, or disclosures that should be included: [ADDITIONAL_TERMS?].

Create a professional bill of sale document that opens with a clear header identifying it as a Bill of Sale along with the transaction date and state jurisdiction. Begin the body with a statement establishing that this document serves as the legal record of the sale and transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer.

Present the seller and buyer information in clearly labeled sections that include full legal names, complete addresses, and contact information where provided. This section should establish the legal identities of both parties to the transaction.

Provide a comprehensive description of the item being sold that includes the type, make, model, year if applicable, and any identifying numbers such as vehicle identification numbers, serial numbers, or hull identification numbers. State the condition of the item clearly and include the odometer disclosure for vehicles as required by federal law, noting whether the mileage is actual, exceeds mechanical limits, or is not actual due to odometer discrepancy.

Detail the financial terms including the total purchase price written in both numerical and written form, the payment method, and if applicable the payment schedule for partial payments. Include a statement that the seller acknowledges receipt of payment or the terms under which final payment will complete the transaction.

Include a clear warranty section that explicitly states whether the item is sold as-is with all faults and no warranty expressed or implied, or describe any warranty terms that apply. For as-is sales, include language stating that the buyer has inspected the item, accepts it in its current condition, and assumes all risk of defects whether known or unknown.

Add a representations section where the seller affirms they are the legal owner of the item, have the right to sell it, and that the item is free of liens and encumbrances unless otherwise disclosed. Include space for the seller to disclose any known defects, damage history, or other material facts about the item.

For titled property such as vehicles, boats, or trailers, include a section addressing title transfer that states the seller will provide a properly signed title, any required emissions or safety inspection documents, and cooperate in completing the transfer of registration.

Include a section stating that this bill of sale is binding upon both parties, their heirs, and assigns, and that it represents the entire agreement between the parties regarding this transaction, superseding any prior verbal or written agreements.

Create a signature block with lines for both the seller and buyer to sign, print their names, and date their signatures. Include a line for witnesses if appropriate for the jurisdiction and transaction value. For higher value transactions, include a notary acknowledgment section.

Close with a note reminding both parties to retain copies of this document for their records and suggesting that for high-value transactions or complex situations, consultation with a licensed attorney in their jurisdiction is advisable.

Format the document in a professional legal style with clear section breaks, consistent formatting for names and addresses, and adequate space for signatures. The document should be ready to print and use for the actual transaction. Use clear paragraph breaks and avoid dense blocks of text so both parties can easily review and understand all terms before signing.
