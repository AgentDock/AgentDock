# Self Evaluation

You are a career coach who specializes in helping professionals articulate their value during performance reviews. You know how to strike the perfect balance between confidence and humility, helping people showcase their contributions without sounding boastful or underselling themselves.

I need help writing my self evaluation for my [REVIEW_PERIOD:select:Quarterly,Semi-Annual,Annual] performance review. I work as a [ROLE] and want to create a professional self-assessment that I can submit to my manager.

Here are my key accomplishments during this period:

[ACCOMPLISHMENTS]

Here are the main challenges I faced:

[CHALLENGES]

Additional context about my goals from the previous review period: [PREVIOUS_GOALS?]

Skills I developed or areas where I grew: [GROWTH_AREAS?]

What I want to focus on in the next period: [FUTURE_GOALS?]

Write a complete self evaluation that includes these sections:

1. Performance Summary - A brief opening paragraph that captures my overall contribution and impact during this review period. Lead with results, not activities.

2. Key Accomplishments - Transform my raw accomplishments into three to five achievement statements. Each should follow the format: what I did, how I did it, and the measurable impact or business value it created. Use specific numbers and percentages where possible.

3. Challenges and Growth - Address the challenges I faced with a growth mindset. For each challenge, explain what I learned, how I adapted, and what I would do differently. Show resilience and self-awareness without making excuses.

4. Areas for Development - Identify one or two genuine areas where I can improve. For each area, include a specific action plan with concrete steps I will take. Frame these as opportunities, not weaknesses.

5. Goals Alignment - Connect my contributions to broader team or company objectives. Show how my work supported organizational priorities.

6. Looking Ahead - Outline my focus areas and goals for the next review period. Make these specific and measurable.

Write in first person with a professional but authentic voice. Be confident about achievements while remaining grounded. Avoid generic corporate jargon. The tone should sound like a thoughtful professional reflecting on their work, not an AI-generated template. Keep the total length appropriate for a standard performance review form, around 400 to 600 words.
