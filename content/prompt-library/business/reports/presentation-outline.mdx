# Presentation Outline Builder

I need to create a presentation that holds attention and delivers my message effectively.

The topic of my presentation is [PRESENTATION_TOPIC].

My audience is [AUDIENCE] and their current knowledge level is [KNOWLEDGE_LEVEL:select:beginner - they know little about this topic,intermediate - they have some familiarity,expert - they know the topic well,mixed - various experience levels].

The main goal of this presentation is [GOAL:select:to inform or educate,to persuade or convince,to inspire or motivate,to sell a product or service,to report on progress or results,to propose a solution or recommendation,to train or teach a skill].

I have [TIME:select:5 minutes,10 minutes,15 minutes,20 minutes,30 minutes,45 minutes or more] to present.

The one thing I want my audience to remember is: [KEY_TAKEAWAY]

Supporting points or data I want to include: [SUPPORTING_CONTENT?]

Create a presentation outline with slide-by-slide structure. Start with a hook that captures attention. Organize the content in a logical flow with clear transitions. Suggest what visuals or data points would strengthen each section. Include where to add stories or examples to make it memorable. End with a strong conclusion and clear call to action. Tell me where to add interaction or pause for questions. Keep the number of slides appropriate for my time limit.
