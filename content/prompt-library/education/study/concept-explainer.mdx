# Concept Explainer

I want to understand a topic and need it explained in a way that actually makes sense to me.

The concept or topic I want to understand is [CONCEPT].

My current understanding of this topic is [CURRENT_LEVEL:select:I know nothing about it,I have heard of it but do not really get it,I understand the basics but want to go deeper,I know it fairly well but have specific gaps].

I want the explanation at a level appropriate for [EXPLANATION_LEVEL:select:a curious 10-year-old,a high school student,a college student,a professional in a different field,an expert wanting nuance].

I learn best through [LEARNING_PREFERENCE:select:simple analogies and comparisons,step-by-step logical breakdown,real-world examples and applications,visual descriptions and mental models,historical context and how it evolved].

If there is a specific aspect I am confused about: [SPECIFIC_CONFUSION?]

Explain this concept clearly at the level I requested. Start with the core idea in one sentence before going deeper. Use analogies or comparisons to things I already understand. Break down any technical terms as you introduce them. Explain why this concept matters or where it applies in the real world. If there are common misconceptions, address them. End with a simple way I can test or verify my understanding.
