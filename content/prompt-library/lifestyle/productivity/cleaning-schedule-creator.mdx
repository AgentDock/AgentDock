# Cleaning Schedule Creator

I need a cleaning schedule I will actually stick to that keeps my home presentable.

My home is [HOME_SIZE:select:a small apartment or studio,a 1-2 bedroom apartment,a small house,a medium-sized house,a large house].

The people living here include [HOUSEHOLD:select:just me,me and a partner,a family with young kids,a family with older kids or teens,roommates,multiple generations].

Pets in the house: [PETS?]

My current cleaning approach is [CURRENT:select:marathon cleaning when it gets bad,cleaning a little bit daily,someone else handles it but I want to help,inconsistent and I need a system,virtually non-existent].

I can dedicate [TIME:select:10-15 minutes per day,20-30 minutes per day,a couple hours on weekends,a mix of daily quick tasks and weekend deep cleaning] to cleaning.

My cleaning pet peeves or priorities: [PRIORITIES?]

Create a realistic cleaning schedule broken into daily quick tasks, weekly cleaning routines, monthly deep cleaning, and seasonal or quarterly tasks. For daily tasks, keep them under 15 minutes total. Spread weekly tasks across different days so no single day is overwhelming. Include specific tasks for each room. Build in flexibility for when life gets busy. Suggest how to divide tasks if others in the household can help. Include a "company is coming" quick clean checklist for last-minute tidying.
