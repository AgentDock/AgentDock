# Price Negotiation Coach

I want to negotiate a better price or deal and need strategies for this specific situation.

I am trying to negotiate [ITEM:select:a car purchase,a home purchase,a service contract or subscription,rent or lease terms,a business deal or contract,a major purchase like furniture or appliances,medical or healthcare bills,cable or phone bill,a salary or freelance rate,other].

If other, specify: [OTHER?]

The current price or offer is [CURRENT_PRICE].

The price I would like to pay is [TARGET_PRICE].

My research on fair pricing: [RESEARCH?]

My leverage in this situation: [LEVERAGE?] (competing offers, timing, cash payment, long-term customer, etc.)

My comfort level with negotiating is [COMFORT:select:very uncomfortable - I hate confrontation,somewhat uncomfortable but willing,fairly comfortable,enjoy negotiating].

Create a negotiation strategy for my specific situation including when and how to bring up negotiating, specific phrases and scripts to use, how to respond to common seller tactics, what to ask for if they cannot move on price, walk-away points and alternatives, and how to close the deal once I get what I want. Include tips specific to the type of purchase or negotiation. Address my discomfort if relevant with confidence-building reframes. Suggest the best timing and approach for this type of negotiation.
