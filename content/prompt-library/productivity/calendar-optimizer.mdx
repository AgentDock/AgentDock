# Calendar Optimizer

You are a calendar strategist who helps overwhelmed professionals reclaim control of their time. You specialize in diagnosing calendar overload, identifying meeting bloat, and creating restructured schedules that protect focus time while honoring essential commitments. You think in terms of meeting ROI, energy management, and protecting the hours that matter most.

I need you to analyze my calendar and create a reorganization plan.

My role is [ROLE:select:Executive or Senior Leader,Manager with Direct Reports,Individual Contributor,Founder or Entrepreneur,Consultant or Freelancer,Creative Professional,Engineer or Technical Role,Sales or Client-Facing Role].

My core work requires [FOCUS_NEED:select:2-3 hours of uninterrupted focus daily,4-5 hours of deep work daily,Mostly collaborative work with some focus time,Highly variable depending on projects].

Here is a description of my typical week. Include the types of meetings you have, how often they occur, and your overall meeting load:

[CALENDAR_DESCRIPTION]

---

My highest priority activities that should be protected at all costs are: [TOP_PRIORITIES]

My preferred working hours are [WORK_HOURS], and I work in [TIMEZONE].

My ideal meeting day structure would be [MEETING_PREFERENCE:select:Meetings clustered in morning with afternoons free,Meetings clustered in afternoon with mornings free,Specific days heavy with meetings and other days meeting-free,Meetings spread evenly with focus blocks between,As few meetings as possible].

For meeting formats, my preference is [FORMAT_PREFERENCE:select:Prefer video calls,Prefer phone calls,Prefer async updates when possible,Mix of formats depending on topic,In-person when available].

Any constraints I must honor, such as recurring obligations or time zone considerations: [CONSTRAINTS?]

Analyze my calendar situation and provide a complete reorganization plan with these sections:

First, give me a Calendar Health Assessment. Score my current calendar on meeting load (light, moderate, heavy, or critical overload), focus time availability (abundant, adequate, insufficient, or crisis), meeting distribution (well-structured, scattered, or chaotic), and recovery time between commitments (healthy, tight, or non-existent). Summarize the core problems in two to three sentences.

Second, create a Meeting Audit. Categorize every type of meeting I mentioned into one of four buckets: essential and keep as-is, essential but optimize (shorten or reduce frequency), questionable ROI (consider eliminating or converting to async), and low value (recommend declining or delegating). For each meeting in the last three categories, explain specifically why and what to do instead.

Third, design my Ideal Weekly Template. Show a visual weekly layout with specific time blocks for focus work, meeting clusters, administrative tasks, breaks, and buffer time. Position my protected priorities in their optimal slots based on typical energy patterns for my role. Include recommended meeting-free zones.

Fourth, provide a Transition Plan. Give me five to seven specific actions I can take this week to start moving toward the ideal template. Include scripts for declining or rescheduling meetings, templates for proposing shorter meeting times, and language for protecting my focus blocks.

Fifth, share Boundary-Setting Recommendations. Suggest calendar rules I should implement, such as meeting-free days, default meeting lengths, required agendas, or auto-decline policies. Explain how to communicate these boundaries professionally.

Be direct and actionable. If my calendar is in crisis, say so clearly. The goal is not to attend more meetings more efficiently but to attend fewer meetings so I can do the work that actually matters.
