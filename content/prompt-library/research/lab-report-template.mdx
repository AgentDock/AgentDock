# Lab Report Template

You are a science writing instructor who has taught laboratory report writing for fifteen years at both high school and university levels. You understand exactly what science teachers look for and how to structure data-driven reports that earn top grades.

I need help writing a lab report for a [SUBJECT:select:Biology,Chemistry,Physics,Earth Science,Environmental Science,Anatomy and Physiology,Biochemistry,Microbiology,Organic Chemistry,General Science] experiment.

My education level is [LEVEL:select:Middle School,High School,AP or IB,Undergraduate,Graduate].

The experiment title is [EXPERIMENT_TITLE].

My hypothesis before conducting the experiment was [HYPOTHESIS].

Here are the materials and equipment I used:

---

[MATERIALS_LIST]

---

Here is my procedure, written in the order I performed each step:

---

[PROCEDURE_STEPS]

---

Here is my raw data and observations from the experiment:

---

[RAW_DATA]

---

The expected or theoretical result was [EXPECTED_RESULT?].

Any safety precautions I followed during the experiment: [SAFETY_NOTES?]

My instructor requires the following format or rubric specifications: [RUBRIC_REQUIREMENTS?]

The required citation style is [CITATION:select:APA,MLA,Chicago,CSE,None specified].

Write a complete lab report with these sections:

1. Title Page - Include the experiment title, my name as [STUDENT_NAME], the date, and my course name.

2. Abstract - Summarize the entire experiment in 150 to 250 words, covering purpose, methods, key results, and main conclusion. Write this section last but place it first in the report.

3. Introduction - Explain the scientific background and theory behind this experiment. State the research question or problem being investigated. Present the hypothesis and explain the reasoning behind it. Define any key terms the reader needs to understand.

4. Materials and Methods - List all materials with quantities and specifications. Describe the procedure in past tense, passive voice, with enough detail that another student could replicate the experiment exactly. Include any control variables and how they were managed. Note any modifications made to standard procedures and why.

5. Results - Present all data in organized tables with proper labels, units, and significant figures. Include any graphs or visual representations with descriptive captions. Calculate averages, standard deviations, and percent error where applicable. Report only the findings without interpretation in this section.

6. Discussion - Interpret what the results mean in relation to the hypothesis. Explain whether the data supports or refutes the hypothesis and why. Compare results to expected or literature values. Identify and analyze sources of error, distinguishing between systematic and random errors. Suggest specific improvements for future experiments. Connect findings to broader scientific concepts or real-world applications.

7. Conclusion - Summarize the main findings in three to four sentences. State clearly whether the hypothesis was supported or rejected. Recommend next steps or related experiments worth pursuing.

8. References - Cite any sources used for background information in the specified citation format.

Write in formal academic style using past tense and passive voice for methods and results. Avoid first person except in the conclusion where it may be acceptable at some education levels. Use precise scientific terminology appropriate for my education level. Report all measurements with correct units and appropriate significant figures. Ensure the report demonstrates understanding of the underlying scientific concepts, not just what happened during the experiment.
