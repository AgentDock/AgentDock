# Weekly Meal Planner

I need a practical weekly meal plan that fits my life and makes grocery shopping easier.

I am planning meals for [HOUSEHOLD_SIZE:select:just myself,2 people,3-4 people,5 or more people].

My dietary preferences or restrictions are [DIETARY_PREFERENCES:select:no restrictions,vegetarian,vegan,pescatarian,gluten-free,dairy-free,keto or low-carb,paleo,halal,kosher] and I also need to avoid or limit: [ADDITIONAL_RESTRICTIONS?]

My weekly grocery budget is approximately [BUDGET:select:tight - need to keep costs very low,moderate - average spending is fine,flexible - quality matters more than cost].

On weeknights I typically have [WEEKNIGHT_TIME:select:15-20 minutes for cooking,30 minutes for cooking,45-60 minutes for cooking,more time - I enjoy cooking] and on weekends I have [WEEKEND_TIME:select:similar time as weeknights,more time for elaborate meals,prefer quick meals on weekends too].

My cooking skill level is [SKILL_LEVEL:select:beginner - simple recipes only,intermediate - comfortable with most recipes,advanced - enjoy complex techniques].

If I have cuisine preferences I want to include: [CUISINE_PREFERENCES?]

Please create a 7-day meal plan for [MEALS_TO_PLAN:select:dinners only,lunch and dinner,all three meals,all meals plus snacks]. For each meal, include the dish name and a one-line description. Estimate prep and cook time for each. Try to reuse ingredients efficiently across the week to minimize waste and simplify my shopping list. At the end, provide a consolidated grocery list organized by store section.
