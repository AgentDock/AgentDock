# Cocktail Recipe Creator

I want to make a delicious cocktail with what I have or try something new.

The spirits or base alcohols I have: [SPIRITS]

Mixers and other ingredients I have: [MIXERS?]

I prefer drinks that are [TASTE:select:sweet,sour or citrusy,bitter or complex,refreshing and light,strong and spirit-forward,creamy or dessert-like,balanced between sweet and sour].

The occasion is [OCCASION:select:casual evening at home,dinner party,date night,brunch,celebration,summer or warm weather,winter or cold weather,just experimenting].

I want something [STYLE:select:classic and timeless,trendy and modern,tropical and fruity,simple with few ingredients,impressive but not too complicated].

If you want a specific vibe or inspiration: [INSPIRATION?]

Create 3 cocktail options ranging from simple to more elaborate. For each one, include the complete recipe with exact measurements, the technique like shaking or stirring, the proper glass to use, garnish suggestions, and flavor notes describing what to expect. Suggest non-alcoholic swaps for any of these drinks if someone wants a mocktail version. Include tips for getting the technique right. If I am missing a key ingredient, suggest alternatives.
