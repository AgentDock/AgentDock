The main problems with this space: [PROBLEMS?] (such as too much stuff, no system, items without homes, etc.)

Create a step-by-step organization plan for this space including how to sort and declutter first, specific zones and categories to create, storage solutions that would work, a realistic timeline based on my available time, and maintenance habits to keep it organized. Tell me what to do with items I am getting rid of. Make the plan manageable so I do not get overwhelmed and quit.
