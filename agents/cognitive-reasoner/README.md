# Cognitive Reasoner

The Cognitive Reasoner is an agent designed to tackle complex problems through a suite of cognitive enhancement tools. It excels at structured reasoning, reflection, comparison, critique, brainstorming, and debate - providing multiple approaches to problem-solving without requiring external data or API calls.

## Orchestration Features

The Cognitive Reasoner now uses advanced orchestration to create optimal tool sequences for different cognitive tasks:

### Research Mode
Activates when queries contain terms related to research, facts, or information:
1. **Search** → Gathers factual information
2. **Think** → Analyzes the information systematically
3. **Reflect** → Extracts insights and implications

### Problem-Solving Mode
Activates for questions about calculations, estimations, or solutions:
1. **Think** → Analyzes the problem structure
2. **Brainstorm** → Generates potential solutions
3. **Compare** → Evaluates options against criteria

### Evaluation Mode
Activates for critiques, assessments, or analyses:
1. **Critique** → Identifies strengths and weaknesses
2. **Debate** → Explores multiple perspectives
3. **Reflect** → Extracts insights and principles

### Comparison Mode
Activates when comparing options or discussing tradeoffs:
1. **Search** → Gathers factual information about options
2. **Compare** → Systematically evaluates against criteria
3. **Reflect** → Draws conclusions and implications

### Ideation Mode
Activates for creative challenges and idea generation:
1. **Think** → Frames the problem clearly
2. **Brainstorm** → Generates diverse solutions
3. **Critique** → Evaluates the ideas for feasibility

### Debate Mode
Activates for controversial topics with multiple viewpoints:
1. **Search** → Gathers facts about different positions
2. **Debate** → Presents balanced perspectives
3. **Reflect** → Extracts principles and insights

## Strengths

The agent is particularly effective for:

- **Logical Problem-Solving:** Complex puzzles, logic problems, algorithmic challenges
- **Mathematical Reasoning:** Probability calculations, statistical analyses, numerical estimations
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Considering multiple viewpoints on complex issues
- **Decision Analysis:** Weighing options using structured frameworks
- **Reflection and Insight Extraction:** Analyzing past experiences to derive meaningful lessons
- **Systematic Comparison:** Evaluating multiple options against clear criteria
- **Balanced Critique:** Providing constructive feedback on ideas, writing, code, or arguments
- **Idea Generation:** Creating diverse solutions to challenging problems
- **Nuanced Debate:** Exploring controversial topics with fair representation of multiple perspectives
- **Complex Systems Analysis:** Understanding interconnected variables and feedback loops
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Breaking down abstract concepts into understandable components

## Cognitive Tools

The agent has six specialized cognitive tools at its disposal:

### 1. Think Tool
Provides structured reasoning for complex problem-solving, breaking down problems into manageable steps with clear logical progression.

### 2. Reflect Tool
Enables retrospective analysis and insight extraction, examining past experiences to derive meaningful lessons and actionable takeaways.

### 3. Compare Tool
Facilitates systematic comparison between multiple options based on well-defined criteria, highlighting key differences and tradeoffs.

### 4. Critique Tool
Offers balanced critical evaluation of arguments, writing, code, or designs, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement.

### 5. Brainstorm Tool
Supports divergent thinking and idea generation, creating diverse solutions across multiple categories for challenging problems.

### 6. Debate Tool
Explores multiple perspectives on complex or controversial topics, presenting different viewpoints with supporting evidence and counterarguments.

## Example Test Prompts

The Cognitive Reasoner can be tested with these prompts targeting each orchestration mode:

### Research Mode
- **Future Trends:** "How many electric vehicles will be on the road by 2030?"
- **Historical Analysis:** "What were the major causes of the 2008 financial crisis?"

### Problem-Solving Mode
- **Urban Planning:** "How can cities solve traffic congestion problems?"
- **Business Challenge:** "How can a small retail business compete with large e-commerce platforms?"

### Evaluation Mode
- **Work Trends:** "Critique the argument that remote work improves productivity"
- **Technology Impact:** "Evaluate the impact of social media on teenage mental health"

### Comparison Mode
- **Energy Options:** "Compare solar and wind energy for residential power generation"
- **Education Methods:** "Compare traditional classroom learning with online education"

### Ideation Mode
- **Food Waste:** "Brainstorm innovative ways to reduce food waste in restaurants"
- **Transportation:** "Generate ideas for sustainable last-mile delivery solutions"

### Debate Mode
- **Financial Future:** "Debate whether cryptocurrencies will eventually replace traditional banking"
- **AI Ethics:** "Debate the ethics of using AI in hiring decisions"

## Implementation Guidance

For optimal results with the Cognitive Reasoner:

1. **Trigger Specific Modes:** Use keywords that align with the orchestration mode you want to activate
2. **Follow the Sequence:** The agent works best when following its orchestrated tool sequences
3. **Provide Context:** Include relevant details in your query
4. **Be Specific:** Clarify what kind of cognitive analysis you're looking for
5. **Engage Iteratively:** Follow up with clarifying questions if needed

## Orchestration Benefits

The orchestrated approach provides several advantages:

1. **Optimal Tool Sequencing:** Tools are used in the most effective order for each problem type
2. **Focused Analysis:** Each mode restricts available tools to those most relevant for the task
3. **Consistent Structure:** Predictable reasoning patterns make outputs easier to follow
4. **Resource Efficiency:** Optimized prompts reduce token usage and improve performance
5. **Task-Specific Processing:** Different cognitive challenges receive specialized treatment

The Cognitive Reasoner combines multiple cognitive enhancement tools in structured sequences to provide versatile problem-solving capabilities for a wide range of complex challenges.
