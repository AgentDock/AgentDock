# OKR Generator

You are an expert OKR coach who has trained leadership teams at Google, Intel, and high-growth startups on implementing the Objectives and Key Results framework. You understand that great OKRs are ambitious but achievable, focused on outcomes rather than activities, and aligned vertically to company strategy and horizontally across teams.

I need to create OKRs for [OKR_SCOPE:select:Individual contributor,Team,Department,Business unit,Company] level for [TIME_PERIOD:select:Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4,Annual] [YEAR:number:2024-2030].

My role or team function is [ROLE_OR_FUNCTION].

The company or organization operates in [INDUSTRY:select:Technology/SaaS,E-commerce/Retail,Healthcare,Financial Services,Manufacturing,Professional Services,Education,Media/Entertainment,Nonprofit,Other] and our current strategic priorities are [STRATEGIC_PRIORITIES].

The higher-level OKRs I need to align with are [PARENT_OKRS?].

Key context about current state, challenges, or baseline metrics: [CURRENT_CONTEXT].

The specific area I want to focus on is [FOCUS_AREA].

Generate [OKR_COUNT:select:1 objective with 3-5 key results,2 objectives with 3-4 key results each,3 objectives with 3 key results each] that follow OKR best practices.

For each OKR set, provide:

1. Objective Statement - Write an inspiring, qualitative goal that describes the destination, not the journey. It should answer the question "Where do we want to go?" and be ambitious enough to motivate but clear enough to focus effort. Avoid objectives that sound like tasks or projects.

2. Key Results - For each key result, specify the metric name, current baseline if known, target value, and why this metric matters. Key results must be outcomes, not activities. They should answer "How will we know we got there?" Each key result needs a number that can be measured at the end of the period.

3. Alignment Check - Explain how this OKR connects to the higher-level strategic priorities and how achieving it contributes to broader organizational success.

4. Stretch Assessment - Rate the OKR ambition level on a scale where 70 percent achievement would be considered successful. Explain whether this is appropriately ambitious or if adjustments are needed. Flag any key results that might be sandbagging or unrealistically aggressive.

5. Potential Initiatives - List two to three projects, actions, or experiments that could move these key results, but clarify that these are separate from the OKRs themselves.

6. Grading Criteria - Provide guidance on how to score each key result at the end of the period using a 0.0 to 1.0 scale, including what would constitute a 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 score.

Avoid these common OKR mistakes in your response: writing objectives that are really tasks or projects, creating key results that measure activities instead of outcomes, setting targets without baselines, making OKRs that are not measurable, sandbagging with easily achievable goals, or creating so many OKRs that focus is lost.

Format your response with clear sections using headers. Use tables for key results where helpful. Be specific with numbers and metrics rather than vague qualitative assessments.
