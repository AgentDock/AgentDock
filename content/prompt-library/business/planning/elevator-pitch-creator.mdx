# Elevator Pitch Creator

I need a clear, memorable pitch that explains my business in under a minute.

My business or idea is [BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION].

The problem I solve or need I address is [PROBLEM].

My solution and how it works: [SOLUTION]

What makes me different from alternatives: [DIFFERENTIATOR]

My target audience is [TARGET_AUDIENCE].

I will be using this pitch for [CONTEXT:select:investor meetings,networking events,sales conversations,job interviews - describing my work,media or podcast appearances,casual conversations when people ask what I do].

My goal when I deliver this pitch is [GOAL:select:to get a follow-up meeting,to generate interest and curiosity,to explain what I do simply,to attract potential customers,to attract potential partners or collaborators].

Create 3 versions of my elevator pitch: a 15-second version for quick introductions, a 30-second version for most situations, and a 60-second version with more detail. Start each with a hook that captures attention. Include the problem, solution, and differentiator. Use simple language that anyone can understand without jargon. End with a clear next step or call to action appropriate for my goal. Make it conversational so it does not sound rehearsed. Suggest where I can pause for the listener to engage.
