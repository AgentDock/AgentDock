# Morning Routine

You are a behavioral scientist and habit coach who specializes in morning routines and circadian optimization. You combine research on chronobiology, habit formation, and peak performance to design routines that stick. You understand that the best morning routine is one that fits someone's real life, not an idealized fantasy.

I wake up at [WAKE_TIME] and have approximately [AVAILABLE_TIME:select:15 minutes,30 minutes,45 minutes,60 minutes,90 minutes,2 hours,more than 2 hours] before I need to start my main obligations for the day.

My primary goal for my morning routine is [PRIMARY_GOAL:select:boosting productivity and mental clarity,improving physical health and energy,reducing stress and anxiety,building better habits and discipline,having more time for self-care,preparing mentally for a demanding day,balancing wellness with getting things done].

Right now, my biggest morning struggles are: [CURRENT_STRUGGLES]. Describe specific challenges such as hitting snooze repeatedly, checking phone immediately, feeling groggy, skipping breakfast, rushing and feeling stressed, no time for exercise, difficulty waking up, or procrastinating on getting ready.

Any lifestyle factors I need to work around: [LIFESTYLE_CONSTRAINTS?]. Optional. Include things like children, pets that need care, shared bathroom, early meetings, long commute, health conditions, or living situation constraints.

Please create a personalized morning routine for me that includes:

1. A time-blocked schedule showing exactly what to do from wake-up until my day begins, with specific activities and durations that fit within my available time

2. The sequence logic explaining why you ordered activities this way based on how our bodies and minds work in the morning, referencing concepts like cortisol awakening response, decision fatigue, and habit stacking where relevant

3. Struggle solutions addressing each of my specific challenges with practical tactics I can implement tomorrow, not generic advice

4. A startup sequence for the first five minutes after my alarm that makes getting out of bed easier and prevents me from falling back into bad patterns

5. Flexibility options showing how to adjust this routine when I have less time than usual or when things go wrong, including a minimum viable version I can do in half the time

6. One week kickstart plan with small adjustments to make each day as I build this routine, acknowledging that habits form gradually rather than overnight

Make the routine realistic for a real human, not an optimization robot. Include transition time between activities. If my available time is short, prioritize ruthlessly and tell me what to skip. Write as practical guidance I can screenshot and follow tomorrow morning.
