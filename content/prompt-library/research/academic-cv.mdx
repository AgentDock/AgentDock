Generate my academic CV with these guidelines:

For section ordering, prioritize based on my career stage and target purpose. PhD students and postdocs should lead with education and research experience. Faculty members should lead with current position followed by education. Grant applications should emphasize research and publications prominently.

For publications, organize into logical subsections such as peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, books authored or edited, conference proceedings, working papers, and manuscripts under review. Use reverse chronological order within each subsection. If I have provided citation format preferences, follow them; otherwise use the standard format for my discipline.

For grants and funding, distinguish between awards received and pending applications. Include funding agency, project title, role (PI, Co-PI, Senior Personnel), amount, and duration for each.

For teaching, group by course level and type. Include course numbers, titles, enrollment sizes where relevant, and any notable pedagogical innovations or outcomes.

For presentations, separate invited talks from contributed conference presentations. Include event name, location, and date.

Format the CV with clear section headings, consistent spacing, and professional typography. Do not include personal information beyond name, institutional affiliation, and professional contact details. Omit any sections where I have not provided content rather than leaving them empty or using placeholders.

The result should be comprehensive yet scannable, demonstrating both depth of experience and clarity of presentation. Academic hiring committees, grant reviewers, and tenure committees will use this document to evaluate my scholarly contributions and potential.
