I just finished a meeting and need you to create professional, structured meeting notes that I can share with all attendees and stakeholders.

The meeting type was [MEETING_TYPE:select:Team Standup,Project Kickoff,Status Update,Brainstorming Session,Decision Meeting,One-on-One,Client Call,Sprint Planning,Retrospective,All-Hands,Board Meeting,Training Session,Interview Debrief].

The attendees were [ATTENDEES].

Here are the main topics we discussed: [TOPICS_DISCUSSED].

These are the decisions that were made during the meeting: [DECISIONS_MADE].

Additional context or notes to include: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Create structured meeting notes with these sections:

1. Meeting header with the type, date as today's date, and a clean list of attendees

2. A two-sentence executive summary capturing the meeting's purpose and main outcome

3. Discussion summary organized by topic, with key points as bullets under each topic heading

4. Decisions made as a numbered list, each decision stated clearly and unambiguously so anyone reading knows exactly what was agreed

5. Action items in a table format with four columns: Owner, Task, Deadline, and Priority. Extract every commitment or next step mentioned and assign it to a specific person. Format each task as a clear directive like "Review proposal and provide feedback" not vague phrases like "Look into proposal." If no deadline was mentioned, suggest a reasonable one based on the task type

6. Next steps section noting any follow-up meetings, pending items requiring input from absent stakeholders, or open questions that need resolution before the next meeting

Write in a professional but conversational tone. Use active voice and be specific. Bold the owner names and deadlines in the action items table so they stand out at a glance. Every bullet point should convey useful information, not filler. The notes should be scannable so someone can find their action items or key decisions in under ten seconds.
