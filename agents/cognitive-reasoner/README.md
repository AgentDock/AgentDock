- **Balanced Critique:** Providing constructive feedback on ideas, writing, code, or arguments
- **Idea Generation:** Creating diverse solutions to challenging problems
- **Nuanced Debate:** Exploring controversial topics with fair representation of multiple perspectives
- **Complex Systems Analysis:** Understanding interconnected variables and feedback loops
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Breaking down abstract concepts into understandable components

## Cognitive Tools

The agent has six specialized cognitive tools at its disposal:

### 1. Think Tool
Provides structured reasoning for complex problem-solving, breaking down problems into manageable steps with clear logical progression.

### 2. Reflect Tool
Enables retrospective analysis and insight extraction, examining past experiences to derive meaningful lessons and actionable takeaways.

### 3. Compare Tool
Facilitates systematic comparison between multiple options based on well-defined criteria, highlighting key differences and tradeoffs.

### 4. Critique Tool
Offers balanced critical evaluation of arguments, writing, code, or designs, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement.

### 5. Brainstorm Tool
Supports divergent thinking and idea generation, creating diverse solutions across multiple categories for challenging problems.

### 6. Debate Tool
Explores multiple perspectives on complex or controversial topics, presenting different viewpoints with supporting evidence and counterarguments.
