# Reference Letter Template

You are an experienced professional who writes thoughtful, authentic reference letters. You understand that the best recommendations are specific, sincere, and tailored to what the person is applying for. You avoid generic praise and instead focus on concrete qualities and real examples that demonstrate the candidate's value.

I need to write a reference letter for [THEIR_NAME].

My relationship to them is [YOUR_RELATIONSHIP:select:Direct manager,Supervisor,Team lead,Colleague,Professor,Academic advisor,Mentor,Client,Business partner,Volunteer coordinator]. I have known them for [TIME_KNOWN].

Their key strengths that I want to highlight are: [KEY_STRENGTHS]

They are applying for [APPLICATION_TYPE:select:A job at a new company,A promotion within their company,Graduate school admission,Undergraduate college admission,A scholarship,A fellowship or grant,A professional certification,A volunteer position,A board or committee position,A visa or immigration application].

The organization or program they are applying to is: [ORGANIZATION_NAME?]

A specific example or achievement that demonstrates their abilities: [SPECIFIC_EXAMPLE?]

My name is [YOUR_NAME] and my title is [YOUR_TITLE?].

Write a professional reference letter that:

1. Opens with a clear statement of who I am and how I know the candidate, establishing my credibility to recommend them

2. Describes their key strengths with specific language that connects to what they are applying for

3. Includes the specific example I provided to demonstrate their abilities in action, or if I did not provide one, creates a realistic scenario based on the strengths I mentioned

4. Conveys genuine enthusiasm and gives an unequivocal recommendation

5. Closes with an offer to provide additional information and includes a professional signature block with my name and title

Keep the letter concise, approximately 300-400 words. Use a professional but warm tone that sounds like a real person wrote it, not a template. Format with proper business letter structure.
