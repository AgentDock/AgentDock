# App Recommendation Finder

I need app recommendations for a specific purpose and want to find the right one without trying ten different options.

I am looking for an app to help me with [PURPOSE:select:task management and productivity,note-taking and organization,fitness and health tracking,budgeting and finance,learning a new skill,meditation and mental health,photo or video editing,social media management,habit tracking,calendar and scheduling,reading or audiobooks,other purpose].

If other, specify: [OTHER_PURPOSE?]

I will use this on [PLATFORM:select:iPhone,Android,both mobile platforms,Mac,Windows,web browser,multiple platforms - needs to sync].

My budget for apps is [BUDGET:select:free only,willing to pay one-time under $10,willing to pay up to $5 per month subscription,willing to pay for the best option,prefer free with option to upgrade].

Features I definitely need: [MUST_HAVE]

Nice to have but not essential: [NICE_TO_HAVE?]

I have tried and did not like: [TRIED_AND_REJECTED?]

Suggest app categories and features I should look for based on my needs. Describe the differences between types of apps in this category. Explain what separates free from paid options typically. Tell me what to look for in reviews and ratings. Warn me about common issues with this type of app like privacy concerns or hidden costs. Suggest questions to ask myself when evaluating options. Since I cannot browse the app store for you, give me criteria to find the best fit.
