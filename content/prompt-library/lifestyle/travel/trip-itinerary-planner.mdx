# Trip Itinerary Planner

I need a detailed travel itinerary that makes the most of my trip without overplanning.

I am traveling to [DESTINATION] for [TRIP_LENGTH:select:a weekend (2-3 days),a short trip (4-5 days),one week,10-14 days,longer than two weeks].

I am traveling [TRAVEL_PARTY:select:solo,as a couple,with family including kids,with friends,as a group tour].

My travel style is [TRAVEL_STYLE:select:relaxed - I prefer a slow pace with downtime,balanced - mix of activities and rest,active - I want to see and do as much as possible,adventurous - off the beaten path experiences].

My main interests are [INTERESTS] (such as history, food, nature, art, nightlife, shopping, adventure sports, etc.).

My budget is [BUDGET:select:backpacker - keeping costs very low,moderate - average spending,comfortable - willing to splurge on good experiences,luxury - money is not a major concern].

Any must-see places or experiences: [MUST_DO?]

Things I want to avoid or am not interested in: [AVOID?]

Create a day-by-day itinerary with morning, afternoon, and evening activities. Include specific recommendations for restaurants, attractions, and neighborhoods. Suggest the best order to visit places based on location to minimize travel time. Build in flexibility and backup options for weather or closures. Include estimated costs where possible. Add practical tips like best times to visit, reservation requirements, or local customs to know. Leave room for spontaneity rather than scheduling every minute.
