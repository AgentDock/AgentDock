# Pet Training Helper

I want to train my pet or fix a behavior problem and need a clear plan.

My pet is a [PET_TYPE:select:dog,cat,bird,other trainable pet] and their age is [AGE:select:puppy or kitten,young adult,adult,senior].

Breed or type if relevant: [BREED?]

I want to [TRAINING_GOAL:select:teach a new command or trick,stop an unwanted behavior,improve leash walking,work on potty training,reduce anxiety or fear,improve socialization,address aggression,crate training].

The specific behavior or command: [SPECIFIC_BEHAVIOR]

Current training history or commands they know: [TRAINING_HISTORY?]

The main challenge I am facing: [CHALLENGE?]

My training approach is [APPROACH:select:positive reinforcement only,mix of methods,not sure what approach to use].

Time I can dedicate to training: [TIME:select:5-10 minutes per day,15-20 minutes per day,multiple short sessions,weekends only].

Create a step-by-step training plan for my goal. Break it into phases starting with foundations. Include exactly what to do, what to say, and how to reward. Tell me how long each phase typically takes. Explain common mistakes that slow progress. Suggest how to handle setbacks. Include when to practice and how often. Tell me signs that my pet is ready to advance to the next step. Warn me about any methods that could be harmful or counterproductive.
