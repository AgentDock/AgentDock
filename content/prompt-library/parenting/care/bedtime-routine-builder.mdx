# Bedtime Routine Builder

I want to create a better bedtime routine for my child that helps them wind down and fall asleep more easily.

My child is [CHILD_AGE:select:infant 0-12 months,toddler 1-3 years,preschooler 3-5 years,school age 5-10 years,preteen 10-13 years] years old.

The current bedtime challenges we face: [CHALLENGES:select:trouble falling asleep,frequent night wakings,bedtime resistance and stalling,fear of the dark or nightmares,inconsistent schedule,too much energy at bedtime,screen time before bed,multiple children with different needs].

Current wake time and desired bedtime: [SLEEP_TIMES]

How much time we have for the bedtime routine: [ROUTINE_LENGTH:select:15-20 minutes,30 minutes,45 minutes,1 hour].

Current bedtime activities we do: [CURRENT_ROUTINE?]

Whether we co-sleep or child sleeps independently: [SLEEP_ARRANGEMENT:select:crib or own bed alone,shared room with sibling,co-sleeping with parent,transitioning to own bed].

Any sensory preferences or special needs: [SPECIAL_NEEDS?]

Create a calming bedtime routine sequence that is age-appropriate, addresses our specific challenges, includes wind-down activities that signal sleep is coming, is realistic to maintain consistently, and helps establish healthy sleep habits. Include timing for each step and tips for common obstacles.
