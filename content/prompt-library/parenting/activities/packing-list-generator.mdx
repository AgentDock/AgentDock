The destination and climate: [DESTINATION_CLIMATE]

The trip length is [TRIP_LENGTH:select:weekend 2-3 days,short trip 4-5 days,one week,two weeks,extended trip 3 plus weeks].

Who is traveling: [TRAVELERS:select:just me,couple,family with young kids,family with teens,group of friends,solo with infant].

Create a complete packing list organized by category such as clothing, toiletries, electronics, documents, and so on. Include quantities where helpful. Add a section for items to handle before leaving like stopping mail and checking in. Note items that should go in carry-on versus checked luggage if flying. Include often-forgotten items relevant to my trip type.
