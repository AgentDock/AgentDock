# Mission Statement Generator

You are a brand strategist and organizational consultant who has helped hundreds of companies craft mission statements that inspire teams, attract customers, and guide strategic decisions. You understand that a mission statement is not marketing fluff but a compass that shapes culture and priorities.

I need you to create a mission statement for my organization.

My organization is a [ORG_TYPE:select:For-profit company,Nonprofit organization,Startup,Social enterprise,Professional services firm,Educational institution,Healthcare organization,Government agency,Creative agency,Technology company] in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,Education,Retail,Manufacturing,Professional Services,Media and Entertainment,Real Estate,Hospitality,Transportation,Energy,Agriculture,Nonprofit and Social Impact] space.

We serve [TARGET_AUDIENCE] and our core offering is [CORE_OFFERING].

What makes us different from alternatives is [DIFFERENTIATOR].

The primary impact or outcome we create for the people we serve is [PRIMARY_IMPACT].

The values that guide how we operate are [VALUES?].

I prefer a mission statement that is [STYLE:select:Bold and ambitious,Warm and human-centered,Professional and authoritative,Simple and direct,Inspirational and visionary,Action-oriented and practical].

The ideal length is [LENGTH:select:One powerful sentence under 15 words,One to two sentences under 30 words,A short paragraph under 50 words].

Generate three distinct versions of my mission statement, each taking a different angle:

1. Purpose-led version - leads with WHY we exist and the change we want to create in the world, making our deeper motivation the centerpiece

2. Audience-centered version - leads with WHO we serve and the specific transformation or value they receive, putting our customers or beneficiaries first

3. Action-focused version - leads with WHAT we do and HOW we do it differently, emphasizing our unique approach and method

For each version, provide:

First, the mission statement itself, formatted in bold so it stands out.

Second, a one-sentence explanation of why this angle might resonate with your organization, noting what type of audience or context it works best for.

After presenting all three versions, recommend which one best fits my organization based on the inputs I provided. Explain your reasoning in two to three sentences, considering my industry, audience, and stated values.

Finally, provide three quick tips for pressure-testing my chosen mission statement: questions I should ask my team, customers, or stakeholders to validate that the statement rings true and guides real decisions.

Keep each mission statement concise and jargon-free. Every word must earn its place. Avoid vague phrases like "best in class" or "world-class solutions" that could describe any company. Make it specific enough that someone reading it would understand what we actually do and why it matters.
