Generate 15 slogan options organized into these five categories, with three slogans in each category.

The first category is Rhythm and Flow. Create slogans that use natural speech patterns, parallel structure, or poetic meter to make them easy to say and remember. These should roll off the tongue.

The second category is Sound Techniques. Create slogans using alliteration, rhyme, or assonance to create sonic hooks that stick in memory. The sound should reinforce the meaning.

The third category is Emotional Appeal. Create slogans that tap directly into the target audience's desires, fears, or aspirations. These should create an immediate gut reaction.

The fourth category is Clever Wordplay. Create slogans using double meanings, puns, or unexpected twists that reward the reader with an "aha" moment. These make people feel clever for getting it.

The fifth category is Simple and Direct. Create slogans that state the core value proposition in the fewest possible words with maximum clarity. No tricks, just truth.

For each slogan, provide the slogan itself in quotes, followed by a one-sentence rationale explaining why it works for this brand. Keep slogans between three and eight words. Avoid cliches, generic phrases, and anything that could apply to any company in the industry. Every slogan should feel ownable by this specific brand.

End with a recommendation of your top three picks and brief guidance on which contexts each would work best, such as advertising campaigns, social media, product packaging, or brand identity.
