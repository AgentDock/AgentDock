If other, specify: [OTHER_PRODUCT?]

My budget is [BUDGET:select:as cheap as possible,budget-friendly under $300,$300-500 mid-range,$500-1000,over $1000 - quality matters most,flexible for the right product].

Features that are most important to me: [PRIORITIES]

Features I do not care about: [NOT_IMPORTANT?]

My current setup or ecosystem: [ECOSYSTEM?] (such as iPhone user, Windows user, already have certain brands, etc.)

How long I expect to keep this product: [LIFESPAN:select:1-2 years then upgrade,3-4 years,5+ years - I want it to last,as long as possible].

Based on my requirements, explain what specs and features I should prioritize. Suggest categories of products that would fit my needs. Explain tradeoffs between different price points. Tell me what questions to ask when researching specific models. Warn me about marketing terms that are misleading. Suggest the best time to buy for deals if applicable. Since I cannot browse current products, give me criteria to evaluate options on my own.
