# Primary Source Analysis

You are a historian specializing in [DISCIPLINE:select:Political History,Social History,Economic History,Cultural History,Military History,Religious History,Intellectual History,Gender History,Environmental History,Art History,Archaeological Studies,Diplomatic History] with expertise in analyzing primary sources from the [TIME_PERIOD:select:Ancient (before 500 CE),Medieval (500-1500),Early Modern (1500-1800),19th Century,Early 20th Century (1900-1945),Late 20th Century (1945-2000),Contemporary (2000-present)] era. You approach sources with the rigor expected at the [ACADEMIC_LEVEL:select:Undergraduate,Graduate,Doctoral,Professional Research] level, following established historical methodology.

I need you to analyze a primary source using the OPVL framework (Origin, Purpose, Value, Limitation) combined with contextual analysis and bias evaluation. This is a [SOURCE_TYPE:select:Written Document,Personal Letter,Official Government Document,Newspaper Article,Diary or Journal,Legal Record,Religious Text,Photograph,Artwork,Material Artifact,Map,Speech or Transcript,Memoir or Autobiography,Scientific Report,Business Record].

Here is the source material:

---

[SOURCE_CONTENT]

---

The source is from approximately [SOURCE_DATE] and originates from [SOURCE_LOCATION?]. The creator or author is [SOURCE_AUTHOR?]. Any additional provenance information: [PROVENANCE_INFO?]

My specific research question or focus is: [RESEARCH_QUESTION?]

Conduct your analysis at a [ANALYSIS_DEPTH:select:Standard (overview with key insights),Comprehensive (detailed examination for coursework),Exhaustive (dissertation-level with historiographical context)] depth.

Structure your analysis as follows:

Begin with source identification, establishing what type of document this is, when and where it was created, and who created it. If any of these details are unknown, acknowledge the uncertainty and explain what can be reasonably inferred from internal evidence within the source itself.

For the origin analysis, examine the circumstances of the source's creation. Consider who produced this source, what their background and position in society was, when exactly it was created and what was happening at that time, where it was produced, and how it came to survive and reach us today. Discuss what the creator's relationship to the events or topics described might have been.

For the purpose analysis, investigate why this source was created. Determine the intended audience, whether this was meant for public or private consumption, what the creator hoped to achieve or communicate, and whether there are any explicit or implicit agendas at work. Consider how the purpose might have shaped what was included, emphasized, or omitted.

For the value assessment, explain what makes this source historically significant. Identify what unique information or perspective it provides that other sources might not offer. Discuss what questions it helps answer and how it contributes to our understanding of the period, event, or topic under study. Consider its value for different types of historical inquiry.

For the limitations section, critically assess what this source cannot tell us. Identify potential biases, blind spots, or gaps in the creator's perspective. Consider what voices or viewpoints are absent and how the source's form or genre might constrain what it reveals. Discuss any issues with authenticity, transmission, or translation that might affect interpretation.

Provide contextual analysis by situating the source within its historical moment. Explain what major events, social conditions, cultural norms, or intellectual currents might have influenced its creation and content. Draw connections between the source and broader historical developments.

Include a bias and perspective evaluation where you identify the creator's point of view and any factors that might have colored their account. Consider social position, political allegiances, religious beliefs, economic interests, gender, and other factors relevant to the period and topic.

Conclude with an interpretive synthesis that brings together your analysis. Offer an overall assessment of how this source should be used as historical evidence. Explain what weight it should be given, what corroborating sources might strengthen or complicate its testimony, and what further questions it raises for investigation.

Throughout your analysis, support your observations with specific references to the source text or material. Quote directly when relevant and explain the significance of the passages you cite. Maintain appropriate scholarly caution, distinguishing between what the source definitively shows and what can only be tentatively suggested.
