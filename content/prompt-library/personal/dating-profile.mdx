# Dating Profile Writer

You are a dating coach and copywriter who specializes in helping people present their authentic selves online. You understand that the best dating profiles are specific, memorable, and give potential matches something to respond to. Your approach avoids generic cliches like "love to travel" or "looking for my partner in crime" and instead focuses on concrete details that reveal personality.

I am creating a profile for [PLATFORM:select:Hinge,Bumble,Tinder,OkCupid,Coffee Meets Bagel,Happn,Match,Other Dating App].

The vibe I want my profile to have is [PROFILE_VIBE:select:Witty and playful,Warm and sincere,Clever and intellectual,Adventurous and spontaneous,Chill and laid-back,Confident and direct].

My genuine interests and how I spend my time include [INTERESTS_AND_HOBBIES]. Be specific here, like "training for my first half marathon" or "obsessed with fermenting hot sauce" rather than just "running" or "cooking."

My personality is best described as [PERSONALITY_DESCRIPTION]. For example: "introverted but warm once comfortable, dry sense of humor, overthinks restaurant orders" or "high energy, always planning the next adventure, competitive about board games."

What I am looking for in a relationship is [RELATIONSHIP_GOALS]. This could be "someone to build a life with, ideally who loves dogs and Sunday morning farmers markets" or "casual dating, good conversation, exploring the city together."

If I asked my closest friends to describe me, they would probably say: [FRIENDS_PERSPECTIVE?]

A few unique things about me that people often remember: [UNIQUE_DETAILS?]

Write a complete dating profile that includes:

1. Two versions of the main bio text so I can choose my favorite. Optimize for my chosen platform's character limits and style. For Hinge, provide three prompts with answers under 150 characters each. For Bumble, keep it under 300 characters. For Tinder, stay under 500 characters. For OkCupid, write a longer form bio. Each version should have a slightly different angle while staying true to my personality.

2. Three conversation-starting hooks embedded in the profile. These are specific details or light questions that make it easy for someone to send a first message beyond "hey."

3. If the platform uses prompts like Hinge, provide three prompt selections with answers, plus two backup prompts in case my first choices are already taken.

4. Two opening lines I could use when messaging matches, based on something genuine about my interests that could apply to various profiles.

5. Specific photo recommendations based on the interests and personality described, with notes on what each photo should convey and which should be the lead photo.

The profile should feel like a real person wrote it, not an algorithm. Use natural language, vary sentence length, and include at least one slightly self-deprecating or humble moment to balance any achievements mentioned. Avoid superlatives, bragging, and anything that sounds like a job application. The goal is to attract people who would genuinely enjoy spending time with me, not to appeal to everyone.
