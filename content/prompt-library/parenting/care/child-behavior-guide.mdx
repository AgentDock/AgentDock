# Child Behavior Guide

I need help with a specific behavior issue and want strategies that actually work.

My child is [AGE:select:toddler (1-2 years),preschooler (3-4 years),early elementary (5-7 years),older elementary (8-10 years),preteen (11-12 years),teenager (13+)].

The behavior I am dealing with is: [BEHAVIOR]

This behavior happens [FREQUENCY:select:occasionally,frequently - several times a day,constantly - all the time,in specific situations].

The triggers or situations where this happens: [TRIGGERS?]

What I have already tried: [ATTEMPTS?]

My parenting style is [STYLE:select:authoritative - firm but warm,permissive - flexible and lenient,structured - rules and consistency,gentle - connection-focused,struggling to find my approach].

Help me understand this behavior developmentally. Is it age-appropriate or concerning? What might be causing it from my child's perspective? Suggest 3-5 specific strategies I can try, starting with the gentlest approach. Tell me what to say in the moment. Explain natural consequences versus punishment. Help me set realistic expectations for how long change might take. Warn me about approaches that might backfire. Let me know when this might need professional support instead.
