# Party Planning Guide

I am planning a party or event and want to make sure everything comes together smoothly.

The type of event is [EVENT_TYPE:select:birthday party for adult,birthday party for child,holiday gathering,dinner party,cocktail party,baby shower,bridal shower,graduation party,housewarming,casual get-together,themed party].

The guest count is approximately [GUEST_COUNT:select:under 10,10-20,20-40,40-75,over 75].

The date is [DATE] and time is [TIME].

The venue is [VENUE:select:my home,outdoor in my yard,rented venue,restaurant or bar,park or public space].

My budget is [BUDGET].

The vibe I want is [VIBE:select:elegant and sophisticated,fun and festive,relaxed and casual,themed and creative,intimate and cozy,kid-friendly chaos].

Theme if any: [THEME?]

Create a complete party planning guide including a planning timeline counting down to the event, a menu with food and drink suggestions that fit my vibe and budget, decoration ideas and ambiance, entertainment and activities to keep guests engaged, a shopping list organized by category, a day-of timeline so I am not stressed, and tips for being present at my own party. Include backup plans for weather if outdoor. Suggest which tasks I can delegate. Flag anything that needs to be ordered or booked in advance.
