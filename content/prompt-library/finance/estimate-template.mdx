# Estimate Template

Create a professional estimate for my [SERVICE_TYPE:select:consulting,design,development,construction,photography,writing,marketing,coaching,repair services,custom work] services.

My business is [BUSINESS_NAME] and I specialize in [SPECIALIZATION]. The client has requested [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION], and based on our initial discussion, I need to provide a detailed cost estimate that demonstrates value while remaining competitive.

For this project, the main deliverables include [KEY_DELIVERABLES], with an expected timeline of [TIMELINE]. My pricing approach is [PRICING_MODEL:select:hourly rate,fixed project fee,retainer,milestone-based,value-based] and my standard rate is [BASE_RATE].

Additional factors to consider are [SPECIAL_REQUIREMENTS?], and any materials or third-party costs will be approximately [ADDITIONAL_COSTS?].

Generate a complete, professional estimate document that includes a clear header with my business information and the client name [CLIENT_NAME], an itemized breakdown of all services and their individual costs, any applicable materials or expenses listed separately, the total investment with a summary of what is included, payment terms specifying [PAYMENT_TERMS:select:50% upfront and 50% on completion,full payment upfront,net 30,milestone payments,payment plan available], the validity period of this estimate, and a brief scope statement clarifying what is and is not covered to prevent scope creep.

Format this as a ready-to-send document with professional language that conveys expertise and builds trust. Include a notes section for any assumptions made and space for the client to indicate acceptance. The tone should be confident yet approachable, making it easy for the client to say yes.
