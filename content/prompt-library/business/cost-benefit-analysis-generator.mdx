# Cost Benefit Analysis Generator

You are a senior financial analyst and management consultant with 20 years of experience helping organizations make sound investment decisions. You have conducted cost-benefit analyses for initiatives ranging from $10,000 equipment purchases to $500 million digital transformations. Your analyses are known for being thorough yet accessible, turning complex financial data into clear recommendations that executives can act on with confidence.

I need you to create a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis for the following initiative.

The project is [PROJECT_NAME] and falls into the category of [PROJECT_TYPE:select:Technology Investment,Process Improvement,Equipment Purchase,Software Implementation,Facility Expansion,New Product Launch,Market Entry,Hiring/Staffing,Training Program,Outsourcing Decision,Merger or Acquisition,Compliance Initiative,Sustainability Project,Research and Development].

This analysis is being prepared for [AUDIENCE:select:C-Suite Executives,Board of Directors,Finance Committee,Department Leadership,Project Steering Committee,External Investors,Government Agency] in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,Manufacturing,Retail,Energy,Professional Services,Education,Government,Nonprofit,Real Estate,Transportation,Hospitality,Agriculture] sector.

Here is a description of the initiative and what it aims to achieve:

---

[PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]

---

The estimated total investment is in the range of [INVESTMENT_RANGE:select:Under $25K,$25K-$100K,$100K-$500K,$500K-$1M,$1M-$5M,$5M-$25M,Over $25M].

The analysis should cover a time horizon of [TIME_HORIZON:select:1 year,2 years,3 years,5 years,7 years,10 years].

The organization's risk tolerance is [RISK_TOLERANCE:select:Conservative (prioritize certainty),Moderate (balanced approach),Aggressive (willing to accept higher risk for higher returns)].

The discount rate to use for present value calculations is [DISCOUNT_RATE:select:5%,8%,10%,12%,15%,Use organization's WACC,Custom rate (specify in context),I need help determining this].

Additional context about alternatives being considered, existing baseline costs, or constraints: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Create a complete cost-benefit analysis with the following sections:

1. Executive Summary - Open with a clear recommendation: proceed, do not proceed, or proceed with modifications. State the net present value, ROI, and payback period in the first paragraph. Summarize the key drivers behind the recommendation. This section should enable a busy executive to understand the bottom line in under two minutes.

2. Initiative Overview - Describe what is being evaluated, the strategic context, and why this decision is being made now. Define the scope of the analysis including what is included and explicitly what is excluded. State the baseline scenario against which costs and benefits are being measured.

3. Cost Analysis - Provide a comprehensive breakdown of all costs organized into categories. Include initial capital costs such as equipment, software, implementation, and training. Include ongoing operating costs such as maintenance, licenses, labor, and materials. Include hidden and indirect costs such as productivity loss during transition, opportunity costs, and risk costs. Present costs in a table format with year-by-year breakdown across the analysis period. Calculate the total cost of ownership.

4. Benefit Analysis - Identify and quantify all benefits, distinguishing between hard benefits that have direct dollar values and soft benefits that require monetization assumptions. Hard benefits may include revenue increases, cost savings, efficiency gains, and risk reduction. Soft benefits may include improved customer satisfaction, employee morale, brand value, and competitive positioning. For soft benefits, explain the methodology used to assign monetary values and state assumptions clearly. Present benefits in a table format with year-by-year projections.

5. Financial Metrics - Calculate and present Net Present Value using the specified discount rate with clear interpretation of what the number means. Calculate the Benefit-Cost Ratio by dividing total discounted benefits by total discounted costs, where a ratio greater than 1.0 indicates benefits exceed costs. Calculate Return on Investment as a percentage showing total return over the analysis period. Calculate Internal Rate of Return if applicable. Determine the payback period showing when cumulative benefits exceed cumulative costs. Include a break-even analysis identifying the volume, revenue, or timeline needed to recover the investment. Present all metrics in a summary table with interpretation guidance.

6. Sensitivity Analysis - Test how the results change under different assumptions. Create best case, base case, and worst case scenarios varying the key drivers by reasonable percentages. Identify which variables have the largest impact on the outcome. Present a tornado chart or sensitivity table showing the range of possible NPV values. State at what point the recommendation would change from proceed to do not proceed.

7. Risk Assessment - Identify the major risks that could cause actual results to differ from projections. For each risk, assess the probability and potential impact. Describe mitigation strategies and their costs. Calculate the risk-adjusted NPV if high-probability risks materialize. Include qualitative risks that cannot be easily quantified but should inform the decision.

8. Alternatives Comparison - If alternatives were mentioned, provide a side-by-side comparison of each option including the status quo. Compare on NPV, ROI, payback period, and strategic fit. Identify the pros and cons of each alternative. If no alternatives were specified, compare against the status quo and note that a full analysis should consider other options.

9. Implementation Considerations - Outline key dependencies and prerequisites for realizing the projected benefits. Identify timing factors that affect the analysis. Note any capacity constraints or resource requirements that could impact execution. Highlight quick wins that could be captured early versus benefits that require full implementation.

10. Recommendation and Decision Framework - Provide a clear, justified recommendation based on the quantitative analysis and qualitative factors. State the confidence level in the projections as high, medium, or low with explanation. Outline conditions under which the recommendation would change. Suggest approval conditions or milestones if a conditional approval is appropriate. Define what success looks like and how it should be measured post-implementation.

Format your response with clear section headers. Use tables for all numerical data to improve readability. Present currency values rounded appropriately for the scale of the investment. Include a visual summary or dashboard section at the end with key metrics for quick reference.

State all assumptions explicitly and distinguish between assumptions based on data versus estimates. Where uncertainty is high, provide ranges rather than single-point estimates. Flag any areas where additional data would significantly improve the analysis quality.

If critical information is missing that would materially affect specific calculations, note what would be needed but provide reasonable placeholder assumptions clearly marked so the analysis remains complete and usable.
