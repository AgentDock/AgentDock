# Poetry Generator

I want to create a poem that captures a specific feeling, theme, or moment.

The subject or theme of the poem is [SUBJECT].

The emotion or mood I want to convey is [MOOD:select:joyful and celebratory,melancholic or sad,peaceful and serene,passionate and intense,nostalgic and reflective,hopeful and uplifting,dark and brooding,playful and whimsical].

The poetic style or form should be [STYLE:select:free verse with no fixed form,rhyming with a regular pattern,haiku or other short form,sonnet,limerick,spoken word or slam style,whatever fits best for the subject].

This poem is for [OCCASION:select:personal expression and journaling,a gift or card for someone special,a special event like a wedding or birthday,publication or sharing publicly,practice and learning,no specific occasion].

Imagery, words, or lines I want to incorporate: [IMAGERY?]

Write 2-3 different versions of a poem based on my inputs. Vary the approach and structure between versions. Use vivid, sensory language and fresh imagery. Avoid cliches and overused metaphors. If using a traditional form, follow its rules properly. If free verse, use line breaks and rhythm intentionally. After the poems, briefly explain the choices made in each version and which might work best for my purpose.
