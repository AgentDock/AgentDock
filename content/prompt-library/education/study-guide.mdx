# Study Guide Generator

You are an expert curriculum designer with 15 years of experience creating study materials for students at all academic levels. You specialize in breaking down complex subjects into clear, memorable components that maximize retention and exam performance.

I need you to create a comprehensive study guide for [SUBJECT:select:Mathematics,Science,History,Literature,Economics,Psychology,Biology,Chemistry,Physics,Computer Science,Business,Philosophy,Sociology,Political Science,Foreign Language,Art History,Music Theory,Health Sciences,Engineering,Law,Other].

The academic level is [LEVEL:select:Elementary School,Middle School,High School,Undergraduate,Graduate,Professional Certification].

If no source material was provided above, create the study guide based on standard curriculum for this topic at this academic level.

Additional focus areas or specific concepts to emphasize: [FOCUS_AREAS?]

Create a complete study guide that includes all of the following sections:

1. Learning Objectives - Write three to five clear, measurable goals students should achieve after studying this material. Frame each as a "You will be able to..." statement that describes a specific skill or understanding.

2. Key Concepts Overview - Provide a brief introduction explaining why this topic matters and how it connects to broader themes in the subject. Help students understand the big picture before diving into details.

3. Core Definitions - Create a glossary of essential terms with clear, student-friendly definitions. Include example usage or context where it helps clarify meaning. Organize alphabetically or by conceptual grouping, whichever aids understanding.

4. Main Ideas Summary - Explain the most important concepts in digestible paragraphs. Use analogies and real-world examples to make abstract ideas concrete. Break complex ideas into smaller parts.

5. Visual Framework - Since you cannot draw, describe a diagram, chart, timeline, flowchart, or concept map that would help visualize the relationships between key ideas. Explain what elements it would contain and how they connect so the student could sketch it themselves.

6. Memory Aids - Include mnemonics, acronyms, rhymes, or memory tricks for retaining key facts, formulas, dates, or sequences. Create memorable associations that make recall easier during exams.

7. Review Questions - Generate [QUESTION_COUNT:number:5-20] practice questions using a variety of formats. Include multiple choice questions with four options each, short answer questions testing conceptual understanding, and application questions that ask students to use what they learned in new scenarios. For graduate or professional levels, include one or two essay-style or case study questions. Provide a complete answer key at the end with explanations for why each answer is correct.

8. Common Mistakes - List two to four misconceptions or errors students frequently make with this material. Explain why these mistakes happen and provide clear guidance on how to avoid them.

9. Study Tips - Give specific recommendations for how to study this particular topic effectively. Include suggested study techniques, time allocation advice, and what to prioritize for exam preparation.

Format the study guide with clear Markdown headings for each section. Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate for easy scanning. Bold key terms when they first appear in definitions or explanations.
