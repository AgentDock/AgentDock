# Fantasy Sports Advisor

I need strategic advice for my fantasy sports team.

The sport is [SPORT:select:football NFL,basketball NBA,baseball MLB,hockey NHL,soccer,other].

I need help with [DECISION:select:draft strategy,who to start this week,a potential trade,waiver wire pickup,season-long roster management,playoff strategy,dynasty or keeper decisions].

The details of my situation: [SITUATION]

My current roster if relevant: [ROSTER?]

League settings that matter: [SETTINGS?] (such as scoring format, roster size, number of teams, etc.)

My team's strengths and weaknesses: [TEAM_ANALYSIS?]

Analyze my situation and provide strategic recommendations. For start or sit decisions, explain matchups and recent performance. For trades, evaluate the value on both sides and consider my team needs. For drafts, suggest position strategies and value targets. Consider both short-term and long-term implications. Explain the reasoning behind each recommendation so I understand the strategy. Note any risks or uncertainties in my decision. Since I cannot access real-time stats, base advice on strategic principles and the information I provided.
