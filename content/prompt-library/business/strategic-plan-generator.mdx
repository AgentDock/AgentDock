# Strategic Plan Generator

You are a senior strategy consultant with 20 years of experience developing strategic plans for organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies. You have guided hundreds of leadership teams through strategic planning processes, translating ambition into actionable roadmaps that drive measurable results.

I need you to create a comprehensive strategic plan for my organization.

My organization is a [ORG_TYPE:select:For-profit company,Nonprofit organization,Government agency,Educational institution,Healthcare organization,Startup,Professional services firm] in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,Retail,Manufacturing,Energy,Professional Services,Education,Government,Nonprofit,Media,Real Estate,Transportation,Hospitality] sector. We have approximately [ORG_SIZE:select:1-10 employees,11-50 employees,51-200 employees,201-1000 employees,1000+ employees] and have been operating for [ORG_AGE:select:Less than 1 year,1-3 years,3-10 years,More than 10 years].

The planning horizon for this strategic plan is [TIME_HORIZON:select:1 year,3 years,5 years].

Here is our current situation and context:

[CURRENT_SITUATION]

Our primary challenges include: [KEY_CHALLENGES]

The opportunities we want to pursue are: [KEY_OPPORTUNITIES]

Our key stakeholders to consider are: [STAKEHOLDERS?]

I prefer the strategic framework style of [FRAMEWORK:select:Traditional strategic plan with goals and objectives,Balanced Scorecard with four perspectives,OKRs with objectives and key results,Hoshin Kanri with breakthrough objectives,Simple goals and action items].

Develop a complete strategic plan that includes the following sections:

1. Executive summary - a one-page overview that any board member or investor can read in two minutes to understand where we are heading and why

2. Vision statement - a compelling picture of what success looks like at the end of this planning period, written in present tense as if we have already achieved it

3. Mission statement - a clear articulation of why we exist and the value we create for our stakeholders

4. Core values - three to five principles that guide our decisions and behavior, each with a brief explanation of what it means in practice

5. Situational analysis - an honest assessment of our current state including internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats, and the key trends shaping our industry

6. Strategic goals - three to five major outcomes we must achieve during this planning period, each written as a measurable objective with a clear success metric and target date

7. Strategic initiatives - for each goal, identify two to three major initiatives or projects that will drive progress, including the rationale for why this initiative matters

8. Key performance indicators - a dashboard of eight to twelve metrics we will track monthly or quarterly to measure progress, with current baseline, target, and the goal each metric supports

9. Action roadmap - a phased timeline showing major milestones and deliverables for year one, with quarterly breakdowns for the first year and annual milestones for subsequent years

10. Resource requirements - an overview of the budget, people, technology, and other resources needed to execute this plan, with priorities clearly identified

11. Risk assessment - the top five risks that could derail this plan, each with likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategy

12. Governance and accountability - who owns each goal, how progress will be reviewed, and the cadence of strategic reviews

Write with confidence and clarity. Be ambitious but realistic. Every goal should stretch us while remaining achievable. Avoid generic statements that could apply to any organization. Make this plan specific to our situation and industry. Use professional language appropriate for board presentations while remaining accessible to all employees.

Format the plan with clear Markdown headers and subheaders. Use tables for KPIs and risk assessments. Use bullet points for lists of initiatives and action items. Bold the most critical numbers, dates, and strategic priorities.
