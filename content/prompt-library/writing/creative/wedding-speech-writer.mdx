# Wedding Speech Writer

I need to give a wedding speech and want it to be memorable without being cringeworthy.

I am giving this speech as [ROLE:select:the best man,the maid of honor,a parent of the bride,a parent of the groom,a close friend,a sibling,another family member].

The couple getting married is [COUPLE_NAMES].

My relationship and history with [WHO:select:the bride,the groom,both of them]: [RELATIONSHIP_HISTORY]

Stories or memories I could share: [STORIES]

What I admire about them or their relationship: [ADMIRATION]

The wedding vibe is [VIBE:select:formal and elegant,casual and relaxed,fun and party-focused,intimate and emotional,traditional,non-traditional or quirky].

I am comfortable with [HUMOR:select:keeping it mostly heartfelt with maybe one light moment,mixing humor and sentiment equally,leading with humor then getting sincere,keeping it purely sincere - no jokes].

The speech should be about [LENGTH:select:1-2 minutes,2-3 minutes,3-5 minutes].

Write a complete wedding speech I can personalize and practice. Start with a hook that gets attention without a tired cliche. Include a story that reveals character or illustrates their relationship. Build to an emotional moment. End with a toast. Balance humor and heart based on my comfort level. Avoid anything embarrassing, inappropriate, or inside jokes the audience would not understand. Include notes on delivery like where to pause or look at the couple. Make it sound like me, not like I hired a speechwriter.
