# Plant Care Guide

I need care instructions for a specific plant to keep it healthy.

The plant I need help with is [PLANT_NAME].

It is [PLANT_LOCATION:select:an indoor houseplant,an outdoor garden plant,a container plant on my patio or balcony].

I need help with [HELP_AREA:select:general care instructions,troubleshooting a problem - leaves yellowing or other issue,watering schedule,repotting or transplanting,propagation,seasonal care changes,all of the above].

If troubleshooting, the problem is: [PROBLEM?]

My current care routine: [CURRENT_CARE?]

The environment the plant is in: [ENVIRONMENT?] (light levels, temperature, humidity if known)

My plant care experience level: [EXPERIENCE:select:black thumb - plants tend to die on me,some experience but still learning,fairly good with plants,experienced gardener].

Provide comprehensive care instructions for my plant. Include optimal light, water, humidity, and temperature requirements. Explain how to tell when it needs water versus when I am overwatering. Describe what healthy versus unhealthy looks like for this plant. If I am troubleshooting, diagnose the likely cause and solution. Include seasonal care changes if relevant. Tell me common mistakes people make with this plant. Note any toxicity concerns for pets or children. Suggest when and how to repot or fertilize.
