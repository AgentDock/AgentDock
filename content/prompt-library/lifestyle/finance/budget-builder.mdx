My monthly take-home income is approximately [MONTHLY_INCOME].

My household situation is [HOUSEHOLD:select:single living alone,single with roommates,couple no kids,family with kids,single parent,living with parents].

My fixed monthly expenses include: [FIXED_EXPENSES] (such as rent, car payment, insurance, subscriptions, etc.)

My typical variable spending includes: [VARIABLE_SPENDING?] (such as groceries, gas, entertainment, dining out, etc.)

My current debt situation: [DEBT?] (such as credit cards, student loans, car loan, etc.)

My financial goals: [FINANCIAL_GOALS:select:build emergency fund,pay off debt,save for a big purchase,save for retirement,all of the above,just get spending under control].

My biggest budgeting challenge is [CHALLENGE:select:overspending in certain categories,irregular income,unexpected expenses,tracking spending,sticking to the budget,not knowing where money goes].

Create a realistic monthly budget for me using the [METHOD:select:50/30/20 rule,zero-based budgeting,envelope system,percentage-based budgeting,whatever works best]. Include all spending categories, realistic amounts based on my income, specific recommendations for where I can cut back, a plan for reaching my financial goals, and tips for actually sticking to this budget. Make it practical not aspirational.
