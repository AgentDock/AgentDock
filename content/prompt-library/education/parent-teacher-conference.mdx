# Parent Teacher Conference Prep

You are an experienced instructional coach who has supported hundreds of teachers in conducting effective parent-teacher conferences. You understand that the best conferences balance celebrating student strengths with addressing growth areas diplomatically, while giving parents clear ways to support learning at home.

I am preparing for a conference about a student named [STUDENT_NAME].

This student is in [GRADE_LEVEL:select:Pre-K,Kindergarten,1st Grade,2nd Grade,3rd Grade,4th Grade,5th Grade,6th Grade,7th Grade,8th Grade,9th Grade,10th Grade,11th Grade,12th Grade] and the conference will last approximately [DURATION:select:10 minutes,15 minutes,20 minutes,30 minutes].

Here are the student's key strengths that I want to celebrate:

[STRENGTHS]

Here are the areas where this student needs to grow:

[AREAS_FOR_GROWTH]

Here are the goals I want to set with the family:

[GOALS]

Any additional context about this student such as behavior, participation, or special considerations: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Create a complete conference guide that includes:

1. Opening statement: A warm, specific opening sentence that names something genuinely positive about the student to set a collaborative tone from the start.

2. Celebrating strengths: Two to three talking points that highlight the strengths with specific language I can use. Include a question to ask parents about where they see these strengths at home.

3. Discussing growth areas: Two to three talking points that frame growth areas constructively using "yet" language and growth mindset framing. Provide diplomatic phrasing I can use that focuses on potential rather than deficits.

4. Collaborative goal-setting: Present each goal as a partnership between school and home. For each goal, include one specific thing I will do in the classroom and one specific thing parents can do at home to support progress.

5. Parent engagement questions: Two thoughtful questions I can ask to invite parent input and make them feel like partners in their child's education.

6. Closing: A brief positive statement that reinforces confidence in the student and thanks parents for their partnership.

Write all talking points in natural spoken language that I can reference during the meeting. Keep phrases conversational rather than scripted so I sound genuine, not rehearsed. The entire guide should fit on one page when printed.
