# Room Rental Agreement Template

Create a professional room rental agreement document that opens with a clear header identifying it as a Room Rental Agreement along with the effective date and state jurisdiction. Include a brief statement establishing that this agreement is entered into voluntarily by both parties and governs the rental of a room within a shared living situation.

Present the parties section with complete information for both the person renting out the room and the tenant, using appropriate terminology based on whether the person renting out is a homeowner, primary tenant with subletting rights, or property manager. Include contact information and emergency contacts where provided.

Describe the premises clearly, including the full property address, a specific description of the room being rented, any furnishings included, and a clear statement about which areas of the property the tenant has access to and which areas are restricted if any.

Detail the lease term section including the start date, whether the agreement is month-to-month or a fixed term, and the conditions for renewal. Explain how the agreement converts to month-to-month after a fixed term expires if applicable.

Present the rent section with the monthly amount, due date, acceptable payment methods, and the grace period and late fee structure if applicable. Include information about where rent should be paid or how electronic payments should be made.

Include a comprehensive security deposit section stating the amount, the conditions under which deductions may be made, the timeline for return after move-out as required by state law, and the requirement for an itemized statement accompanying any deductions from the deposit.

Address utilities thoroughly, specifying which utilities are included in rent, how shared utilities are split among occupants, the expected process for utility payments if the tenant contributes, and who holds utility accounts in their name.

Create a detailed shared living arrangements section that covers common area access and usage expectations, kitchen privileges including assigned refrigerator and cabinet space if applicable, bathroom sharing arrangements, laundry access and schedules, and any limitations on common area use during certain hours.

Include a house rules section covering quiet hours, guest policies including overnight guest limitations, smoking restrictions, alcohol policies if applicable, and pet policies. Address modern considerations such as expectations around work-from-home arrangements in common areas and video call etiquette in shared spaces.

Detail cleaning and maintenance responsibilities, including whether a cleaning schedule rotation exists, expectations for keeping personal and common areas clean, how cleaning supplies are handled, and the process for reporting maintenance issues.

Include a parking and storage section addressing any assigned parking, street parking rules, and storage space allocation within the property.

Add a termination section stating the notice period required from both parties, the process for giving notice, move-out expectations including cleaning and key return, and any early termination provisions or penalties.

Include standard legal provisions addressing the governing law of the state, severability of provisions, modification requirements, and a statement that this agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties.

Create a signature block with lines for both parties to sign, print their names, and date their signatures. If the person renting out is a primary tenant subletting with landlord permission, include a line for the property owner or manager to acknowledge and approve the sublease.

Close with an important notice reminding both parties that this document is provided as a template and general guide, that laws regarding room rentals and landlord-tenant relationships vary significantly by state and locality, and that both parties should consult with a licensed attorney in their jurisdiction to ensure the agreement complies with all applicable laws and adequately protects their interests before signing. Note that the person providing the room should verify any local requirements for rental agreements, security deposit limits, required disclosures, and habitability standards.

Format the document in a professional legal style with clear section breaks, consistent formatting, and adequate space for signatures. The document should be comprehensive enough to address the complexities of shared living arrangements while remaining clear and accessible to both parties.
