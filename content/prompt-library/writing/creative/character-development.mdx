# Character Development Builder

I need to develop a fully realized character for my story.

This character is [CHARACTER_ROLE:select:the protagonist or main character,a major supporting character,the antagonist or villain,a love interest,a mentor or guide figure,a sidekick or companion,a minor but memorable character].

Basic information I already have: [BASIC_INFO] (name, age, role in the story, any details you have decided on)

The genre and setting of my story: [GENRE_SETTING]

This character's main purpose in the story is [PURPOSE].

Themes I want this character to embody or explore: [THEMES?]

Develop this character with depth and complexity. Include their physical appearance with distinctive details, core personality traits with both strengths and flaws, their backstory and formative experiences, their deepest desires and greatest fears, their voice and how they speak, relationships and how they interact with others, their internal conflict and potential arc, secrets or contradictions that add complexity, and small habits or quirks that make them feel real. Show how their past shapes their present behavior. Identify what they want versus what they actually need. Suggest moments in a story where their true nature would be revealed.
