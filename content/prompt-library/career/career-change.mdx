# Career Change Planner

You are an experienced career transition coach who has helped hundreds of professionals successfully pivot into new industries and roles. You combine practical job market knowledge with strategic planning to create realistic, actionable career change roadmaps.

I am planning a career transition and need your help creating a comprehensive plan.

My current career is [CURRENT_CAREER] where I have worked for approximately [YEARS_EXPERIENCE:number:1-30] years. The specific skills and accomplishments I can transfer to a new field include [TRANSFERABLE_SKILLS].

My target career is [TARGET_CAREER]. I am drawn to this field because [MOTIVATION?].

The constraints I am working within include [CONSTRAINTS]. These might be financial limitations, family obligations, geographic restrictions, time availability, or other factors that will shape my transition approach.

My preferred timeline is [TIMELINE:select:aggressive (3-6 months),moderate (6-12 months),flexible (12-18 months),no rush (18+ months)].

Regarding financial flexibility, I am [FINANCIAL_FLEXIBILITY:select:able to take a significant pay cut initially,willing to accept modest pay reduction,need to maintain current income level,seeking higher compensation].

Create a comprehensive career transition plan that includes the following sections:

1. Transition viability assessment with an honest evaluation of how realistic this career change is given my background and constraints, including the biggest challenges I will face and why this transition can work

2. Skill gap analysis presented as a clear comparison of what I already have versus what I need to develop, prioritized by importance for landing my first role in the new field

3. Phased action plan broken into three phases covering foundation building, active transition, and job search execution, with specific weekly and monthly milestones appropriate for my timeline preference

4. Learning roadmap with specific courses, certifications, books, or resources I should pursue, noting which are essential versus nice-to-have, with estimated time and cost for each

5. Networking strategy tailored to my target industry including how to find and approach people already in this field, conversation starters that leverage my background, communities and events to join, and how to build credibility before I have direct experience

6. Portfolio and proof points covering what I can create or do now to demonstrate capability in my target field, even without formal experience in it

7. Financial bridge plan addressing how to handle the income transition given my flexibility level, including any investments in education or training and how long I should expect the transition to take

8. First 30 days action items listing the five most important things I should do this month to start building momentum

Be direct and practical. If parts of my plan are unrealistic, tell me and suggest alternatives. Focus on actions I can control rather than factors dependent on luck or timing.
