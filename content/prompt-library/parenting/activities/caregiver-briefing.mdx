The caregiver is [CAREGIVER:select:new babysitter,regular babysitter who needs updated info,grandparent or family member,nanny,friend watching kids,overnight caregiver].

The ages of my children: [CHILDREN_AGES]

The length of care needed: [DURATION:select:a few hours daytime,evening until bedtime,overnight,multiple days,regular ongoing care].

Any special needs or medical conditions: [SPECIAL_NEEDS?]

Allergies or dietary restrictions: [ALLERGIES?]

Current medications: [MEDICATIONS?]

Activities planned or allowed during care: [ACTIVITIES?]

House rules that must be followed: [HOUSE_RULES?]

Anything the caregiver should know about each child's personality or needs: [PERSONALITY_NOTES?]

Create a comprehensive caregiver briefing that includes emergency contacts and procedures, daily schedule and routines, feeding instructions and food restrictions, nap and bedtime procedures, discipline approach and house rules, what to do if certain situations arise, location of important items, and any child-specific information they need to know. Format it so it is easy to reference quickly.
