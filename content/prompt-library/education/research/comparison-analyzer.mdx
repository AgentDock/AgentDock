# Comparison Analyzer

I need to compare multiple options systematically to make a good choice.

I am comparing [OPTION_1] versus [OPTION_2] (and additional options if any: [MORE_OPTIONS?]).

The category or type of comparison is [CATEGORY:select:products or purchases,services or subscriptions,career or job opportunities,locations or places to live,schools or programs,strategies or approaches,tools or software,other].

My primary decision criteria are: [CRITERIA]

Factors that are deal-breakers for me: [DEAL_BREAKERS?]

My constraints like budget or time: [CONSTRAINTS?]

Who this decision affects besides me: [STAKEHOLDERS?]

Create a comprehensive comparison analysis. For each option, list key features and characteristics, pros and cons relative to my criteria, cost and value assessment, potential risks or downsides, and ideal use case or who it is best for. Then provide a side-by-side comparison table of the most important factors. Analyze tradeoffs between options. Give a clear recommendation based on my criteria and explain the reasoning. Note if there is no clear winner and what would tip the decision either way.
