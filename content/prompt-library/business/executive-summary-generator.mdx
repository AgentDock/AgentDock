I need to create an executive summary for senior decision makers. The source material is a [DOCUMENT_TYPE:select:quarterly report,strategic plan,project proposal,market analysis,financial review,operational assessment,risk assessment,competitive analysis,annual report,investment memo].

The primary audience is [AUDIENCE:select:C-suite executives,board of directors,investors and shareholders,department heads,external stakeholders] who will use this summary to [DECISION_CONTEXT:select:approve budget allocation,decide on strategic direction,evaluate investment opportunity,assess project viability,understand performance trends,make hiring or restructuring decisions].

The time sensitivity is [URGENCY:select:decision needed within 48 hours,standard quarterly review,informational only,crisis response requiring immediate action].

Here is the source content to summarize:

[PASTE_SOURCE_CONTENT]

Additional context the reader needs to know: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Create an executive summary following this structure:

Start with a single headline statement that answers the question the reader walked in with. Do not bury the lead. If you are asking for money, state the amount. If you are recommending a decision, state it clearly. If performance is off track, say so directly.

Follow with a situation overview in two to three sentences that establishes context without repeating information the audience already knows. Assume they are informed about general industry conditions and focus on what is specific to this situation.

Present key findings as three to five bullet points. Each finding must include a specific number, percentage, or date. Pair each data point with its business implication. Avoid findings that do not connect to the decision at hand.

Include a financial impact section only if relevant. Quantify costs, savings, revenue implications, or ROI projections. If the numbers are estimates, state the confidence level or range.

Provide recommendations as concrete next steps. Each recommendation should specify who needs to act, what they need to do, and by when. Flag any resource requirements, dependencies, or risks.

End with a clear ask. State exactly what you need from the reader. If approval is required, specify what is being approved. If the summary is informational, state what action you expect them to take with this information.

Keep the entire summary under 400 words. Use active voice and short sentences. Bold the single most important number or conclusion. Avoid jargon unless it is standard vocabulary for this audience.
