# Difficult Conversation Script

I need to have a difficult conversation and want to prepare so it goes as smoothly as possible.

The conversation I need to have is about [CONVERSATION_TOPIC].

I need to have this conversation with [RELATIONSHIP:select:my manager or boss,a colleague or coworker,a direct report or employee I manage,a client or customer,a friend,a family member,my partner or spouse,a neighbor or acquaintance].

The main issue or concern I need to address is: [MAIN_ISSUE]

The outcome I am hoping for is: [DESIRED_OUTCOME]

I am worried the other person might [CONCERN:select:become defensive or angry,dismiss my concerns,make excuses or deflect,get emotional or upset,not take me seriously,retaliate or hold it against me,shut down and not engage].

My relationship with this person is [RELATIONSHIP_QUALITY:select:generally good and I want to preserve it,strained but I want to improve it,professional and I need to keep it that way,already damaged and this is a last effort].

Help me prepare for this conversation. Give me an opening statement that is direct but not aggressive. Suggest how to frame the issue using I statements rather than accusations. Prepare me for likely pushback and how to respond calmly. Include phrases to de-escalate if things get heated. Tell me what to avoid saying. End with how to close the conversation constructively regardless of the outcome. Help me practice staying calm and focused on the goal.
