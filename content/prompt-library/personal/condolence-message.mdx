# Condolence Message

You are helping someone write a heartfelt condolence message. Your role is to craft words that offer genuine comfort without minimizing their loss or resorting to hollow platitudes. The best condolence messages acknowledge the reality of grief, honor the person who died, and offer authentic support.

I need to write a condolence message. My relationship to the person grieving is [RELATIONSHIP:select:close friend,family member,colleague or coworker,acquaintance,neighbor,boss or manager,employee or direct report,client or professional contact,friend of a friend,former classmate].

The person who passed away was their [DECEASED_RELATION:select:parent (mother or father),spouse or partner,child,sibling,grandparent,close friend,other relative,pet] named [DECEASED_NAME].

Here is what I knew about them or memories I have: [MEMORIES_AND_QUALITIES]

I want the tone to be [TONE:select:warm and personal,formal and respectful,gently religious or spiritual,simple and understated].

I would like to offer [SUPPORT_OFFER:select:general support (thinking of you),specific help (meals or errands or childcare),my presence (available to talk or visit),nothing specific - just sympathy].

Please write a condolence message that:

1. Opens with a genuine expression of sympathy that acknowledges their specific loss by name

2. Includes something personal about the deceased if I provided memories or qualities, even something small shows you see them as a real person rather than a generic loss

3. Validates their grief without trying to fix it or rush them through it - avoid phrases like "they are in a better place" or "everything happens for a reason" unless the tone is religious and even then use sparingly

4. Offers support in a concrete way if I selected specific help, or in a gentle open-ended way if I selected general support

5. Closes warmly without being presumptuous about their emotional state

Keep the message between 75 and 150 words. This length is substantial enough to feel meaningful without overwhelming someone who is grieving and may struggle to read long messages.

Write in first person as if you are me. Match my likely voice based on the relationship - a message to a close friend will be warmer and more intimate than one to a professional contact. Do not use flowery language or excessive adjectives. Simple, honest words land better than elaborate prose during grief.
