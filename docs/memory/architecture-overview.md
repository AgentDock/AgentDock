## PRIME: Intelligent Memory Extraction

**Purpose**: Transform conversations into structured memories

```
Raw Message: "I met Sarah at the coffee shop, she mentioned the project deadline is Friday"

                              ▼ PRIME Extraction

Extracted Memories:
├─ Person: "Sarah" (Semantic)
├─ Location: "coffee shop" (Episodic)  
└─ Deadline: "project due Friday" (Procedural)
```

**Key Features**:
- Smart model selection (fast/balanced/accurate)
- Rule-based extraction guidance
- Cost optimization with budget tracking
- Real-time message processing

## Memory System: Vector-First Storage & Retrieval

**Purpose**: Store, index, and retrieve memories efficiently

```
Query: "What did Sarah say about deadlines?"

                              ▼ Vector + Text Search

Memory Storage:
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  Embeddings │    FTS5     │   Metadata  │
│   [0.1,0.2] │  "deadline" │   semantic  │
│   [0.3,0.4] │   "friday"  │   episodic  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

                              ▼ Hybrid Scoring (70% vector + 30% text)

Results: [Sarah deadline memory, related project memories...]
```

**Key Features**:
- Hybrid vector + text search
- Multiple storage adapters (PostgreSQL, SQLite, ChromaDB)
- Memory type specialization
- Performance: <50ms recall

## Advanced Features

### PRIME Extraction
- **Rule-based guidance**: Natural language extraction rules
- **Tier optimization**: Auto-select model based on complexity
- **Cost intelligence**: Budget tracking with <$20/month for 100k operations

### Memory Retrieval  
- **Vector-first**: Semantic similarity using text-embedding-3-small
- **Hybrid search**: Combines vector (70%) + text (30%) scoring
- **Multi-adapter**: PostgreSQL ts_rank_cd + SQLite FTS5 BM25
- **Performance**: <50ms recall, >95% accuracy

## Competitive Advantages

| Feature | AgentDock | Competitors |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Extraction Intelligence | PRIME with rules | Basic LLM |
| Storage Architecture | Hybrid vector+relational | Vector-only |
| Adapter Support | 5 adapters | 1-2 adapters |
| Managed Service Compatibility | ✅ No extensions | ❌ Requires extensions |
| Cost Optimization | Built-in tracking | External |

## Memory Connections: Graph-like Knowledge

**Purpose**: Automatically discover and maintain relationships between memories

**Key Features**:
- Progressive enhancement: embedding → user rules → LLM analysis
- Hybrid SQL + in-memory graph approach (no dedicated graph database needed)
- Temporal pattern recognition for time-based connections
- Research-based connection types (similar, causal, hierarchical)

See [Memory Connections](./memory-connections.md) for detailed explanation and [Graph Architecture](./graph-architecture.md) for technical implementation.

## Summary

**PRIME**: Intelligent extraction from conversations  
**Memory System**: Fast, accurate memory retrieval  
**Memory Connections**: Relationship discovery and knowledge graphs  
**Together**: Complete memory pipeline from raw text to connected knowledge, enabling **Conversational RAG** through agent runtime memory injection

For RAG implementation details, see [Conversational RAG Guide](./retrieval-augmented-generation.md).

AgentDock provides clean architectural separation with no content duplication across memory types while maintaining production-ready performance.
