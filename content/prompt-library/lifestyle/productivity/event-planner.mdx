# Event Planning Coordinator

I need help planning an event and want to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.

The event type is [EVENT_TYPE:select:wedding,birthday party,baby shower,graduation party,holiday gathering,corporate event,reunion,fundraiser,dinner party,retirement party].

The event date is [EVENT_DATE] and I have [TIME_TO_PLAN:select:less than 2 weeks,2-4 weeks,1-2 months,3-6 months,more than 6 months] to plan.

Expected number of guests: [GUEST_COUNT:select:intimate 10-20,small 20-50,medium 50-100,large 100 plus].

The venue is [VENUE:select:my home,rented venue,restaurant,outdoor location,still deciding].

My budget is [BUDGET].

Theme or vision for the event: [THEME?]

Services I need to arrange: [SERVICES?] (such as catering, decorations, entertainment, photography, etc.)

My biggest planning concern: [CONCERN:select:staying within budget,coordinating all the details,making it special and memorable,managing guest logistics,doing it all myself].

Create a comprehensive event planning guide with a reverse timeline of tasks leading up to the event, a detailed checklist organized by category, budget allocation suggestions, vendor questions to ask, day-of timeline and logistics, backup plans for common issues, and delegation suggestions if I have help. Make sure nothing important gets forgotten.
