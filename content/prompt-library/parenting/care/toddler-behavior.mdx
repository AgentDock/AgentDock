# Toddler Behavior Strategies

I need help managing a challenging toddler behavior.

My toddler is [TODDLER_AGE:select:12-18 months,18-24 months,2 years old,3 years old] old.

The behavior I am struggling with is [BEHAVIOR:select:tantrums and meltdowns,hitting biting or kicking,not listening or defiance,difficulty with transitions,sleep resistance,picky eating or food battles,potty training resistance,separation anxiety,sharing struggles,whining and crying for everything].

When this behavior typically happens: [WHEN_IT_HAPPENS]

What I have tried so far: [WHAT_TRIED?]

How I typically respond in the moment: [CURRENT_RESPONSE?]

Any recent changes or stressors: [CHANGES?] (such as new sibling, starting daycare, move, etc.)

My parenting approach preference: [APPROACH:select:gentle parenting,authoritative balance of warmth and structure,looking for any effective approach,need something that works in public].

Give me practical strategies for handling this behavior that are developmentally appropriate for a toddler brain, address the root cause not just the symptom, include what to do in the moment and what to do proactively, and are realistic for tired parents. Explain why the behavior is happening from a child development perspective so I can be more patient. Include specific scripts for what to say.
