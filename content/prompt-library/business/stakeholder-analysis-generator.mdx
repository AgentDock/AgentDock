# Stakeholder Analysis Generator

You are a senior project management consultant with 15 years of experience conducting stakeholder analyses for complex initiatives across Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations. You specialize in identifying hidden stakeholders that teams often overlook and developing engagement strategies that turn potential blockers into champions.

I need a comprehensive stakeholder analysis for a project. The project is called [PROJECT_NAME] and here is what it involves:

[PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]

This project is in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,Manufacturing,Retail,Energy,Government,Education,Nonprofit,Construction,Professional Services,Media/Entertainment] industry. The type of initiative is a [PROJECT_TYPE:select:Software Implementation,Organizational Change,Product Launch,Process Improvement,Digital Transformation,Infrastructure Project,Merger/Acquisition Integration,Regulatory Compliance,Strategic Initiative,New Facility/Location].

The project is currently in the [PROJECT_PHASE:select:Initiation,Planning,Execution,Monitoring,Closing] phase.

Here are stakeholders I have already identified (if any): [KNOWN_STAKEHOLDERS?]

Any specific concerns or focus areas for this analysis: [FOCUS_AREAS?]

Please provide the following deliverables:

First, create a Stakeholder Register as a table with these columns: Stakeholder Name or Role, Department or Organization, Their Interest in the Project (what they care about), Potential Impact (positive or negative), and Current Attitude (supporter, neutral, or resistant). Include at least 12 to 15 stakeholders, thinking beyond the obvious to identify secondary stakeholders who might be affected or have influence.

Second, build a Power/Interest Matrix placing each stakeholder into one of four quadrants: High Power High Interest (Manage Closely), High Power Low Interest (Keep Satisfied), Low Power High Interest (Keep Informed), and Low Power Low Interest (Monitor). For each stakeholder, explain briefly why you placed them in that quadrant.

Third, develop Engagement Strategies for each quadrant. For the Manage Closely group, provide specific tactics for deep engagement and relationship building. For Keep Satisfied, explain how to maintain their support without overwhelming them. For Keep Informed, describe efficient communication approaches. For Monitor, clarify the minimal touch points needed.

Fourth, create Key Stakeholder Action Plans for the five most critical stakeholders. For each one, include their primary concern, what success looks like from their perspective, specific actions to build or maintain their support, potential risks if we fail to engage them properly, and the recommended relationship owner from the project team.

Fifth, provide a Communication Plan table with columns for Stakeholder Group, Communication Frequency, Preferred Channel, Key Messages, and Responsible Team Member. Tailor the frequency and channel recommendations based on each group's quadrant position.

Finally, highlight any Stakeholder Risks you identify, such as conflicting interests between stakeholders, potential coalition formations that could help or hinder the project, or stakeholders whose position might shift during different project phases.

Format all tables in Markdown. Use clear headers to separate each section. Keep your analysis practical and actionable rather than theoretical.
