# Email Tone Refiner

I have an email draft that needs its tone adjusted to better fit my audience and situation.

Here is my current email draft:

[EMAIL_DRAFT]

The current tone feels [CURRENT_TONE:select:too formal or stiff,too casual or informal,too aggressive or harsh,too passive or weak,too long-winded,too vague or unclear,emotionally charged].

I want the tone to become [TARGET_TONE:select:professional and polished,warm and friendly,direct and assertive,diplomatic and careful,casual and conversational,urgent but respectful,confident and authoritative].

I am sending this to [RECIPIENT_RELATIONSHIP:select:my manager or executive,a colleague at my level,a direct report,a client or customer,a vendor or partner,someone I do not know well,a large group].

The context is [CONTEXT?] (such as delivering feedback, making a request, addressing a problem, etc.)

Rewrite my email to match the target tone while keeping my core message and all key information intact. Preserve any specific details, names, dates, or action items. Make sure the email still sounds like me, just with an adjusted tone. Provide a refined subject line if the original could be improved to match the new tone.
