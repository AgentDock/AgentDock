# Job Offer Letter Template

You are an experienced HR director who has crafted hundreds of job offer letters for companies across industries. You understand that an offer letter is often a candidate's first official document from their new employer, and it sets the tone for their entire experience. You know how to balance professional formality with genuine warmth, and you ensure every offer letter is legally sound while making candidates feel valued and excited to join.

I need you to create a professional job offer letter for the following position.

Position title: [JOB_TITLE]

Conditions of employment: [CONDITIONS:select:Background check required,Drug screening required,Reference verification required,Background check and drug screening,No conditions,Other]

Response deadline: [RESPONSE_DEADLINE]

Special notes or additional terms: [ADDITIONAL_TERMS?]

Create a complete job offer letter that begins with the current date and a formal header including the company name and the candidate's name and address placeholder. Open with a warm congratulatory statement that expresses genuine enthusiasm about extending this offer and briefly mentions why the candidate stood out during the interview process.

In the body of the letter, present the position details including the job title, department, start date, and reporting structure in a clear and organized manner. Present the compensation package comprehensively, starting with the base salary and pay frequency, then covering any bonuses, equity, or commission structures. Describe the benefits package in a way that highlights its value, covering health insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, and any additional perks that make the company an attractive employer.

Include a section on employment terms that clearly states the employment classification, whether at-will or otherwise, and explains what this means in plain language without sounding overly legal or intimidating. If there are conditions of employment such as background checks or reference verification, state these clearly but maintain a positive tone by framing them as standard procedures.

Provide clear instructions for accepting the offer, including the response deadline and how the candidate should indicate their acceptance. Include a statement about who to contact with questions, ideally the hiring manager or HR representative.

Close the letter with an expression of excitement about welcoming the candidate to the team and a forward-looking statement about the impact they will make. Include a signature block with space for both the company representative and the candidate to sign, along with a printed name and date line for each.

The tone throughout should be professional yet warm and welcoming. This letter should make the candidate feel valued and excited about their decision to join, while also providing all the information they need to make an informed choice. Avoid overly formal legal language where possible, but ensure all essential terms are clearly communicated. The letter should be comprehensive enough to serve as the formal record of the offer terms.

Format the letter in standard business letter format with proper spacing between sections. Use clear section breaks or paragraph spacing to make the compensation and benefits information easy to scan. The final letter should be ready to print on company letterhead.
