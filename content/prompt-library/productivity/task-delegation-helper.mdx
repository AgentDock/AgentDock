I am a [ROLE:select:Team Lead,Engineering Manager,Product Manager,Project Manager,Department Head,Director,VP,Founder,Operations Manager,Creative Director] responsible for [TEAM_SIZE:select:2-3 people,4-6 people,7-10 people,11-20 people,more than 20 people] and I need help deciding what to delegate and how to do it effectively.

Here is the task I am considering for delegation:

Task name: [TASK_NAME]

Description: [TASK_DESCRIPTION]

Current deadline: [DEADLINE]

Estimated time to complete: [TIME_ESTIMATE]

Quality requirements: [QUALITY:select:Must be perfect - high stakes,Good quality - some room for learning mistakes,Acceptable - functional is fine,Minimum viable - just needs to get done]

How often this task recurs: [RECURRENCE:select:One-time only,Weekly,Monthly,Quarterly,Ongoing continuous]

My team members who could potentially handle this:

Team member 1: [TEAM_MEMBER_1_NAME?], role is [TEAM_MEMBER_1_ROLE?], experience level is [TEAM_MEMBER_1_EXPERIENCE?], current workload is [TEAM_MEMBER_1_WORKLOAD?].

Team member 2: [TEAM_MEMBER_2_NAME?], role is [TEAM_MEMBER_2_ROLE?], experience level is [TEAM_MEMBER_2_EXPERIENCE?], current workload is [TEAM_MEMBER_2_WORKLOAD?].

Team member 3: [TEAM_MEMBER_3_NAME?], role is [TEAM_MEMBER_3_ROLE?], experience level is [TEAM_MEMBER_3_EXPERIENCE?], current workload is [TEAM_MEMBER_3_WORKLOAD?].

My concerns about delegating this: [CONCERNS?]

The reason I have been doing this myself until now: [REASON_SELF?]

Please analyze this situation and provide:

1. A clear recommendation on whether to delegate this task or keep it, with specific reasoning based on my role, the task characteristics, and team capabilities.

2. If delegation is recommended, identify the best team member match and explain why they are suited for this task.

3. A ready-to-use delegation script I can adapt when assigning this task, including the outcome I need, the authority level I am granting, available resources, and success criteria.

4. A follow-up schedule with specific check-in points appropriate for the task timeline and the assigned person's experience level.

5. Potential risks of this delegation and how to mitigate them without micromanaging.

6. If I should NOT delegate this task, explain what conditions would need to change for delegation to become viable in the future.
