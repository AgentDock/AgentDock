# Priority Matrix Creator

I need help organizing my tasks using an Eisenhower priority matrix. Here are all the tasks I am currently tracking or need to complete:

[TASKS]

The type of work I do is [WORK_TYPE:select:Business/Corporate,Startup/Entrepreneurship,Creative/Freelance,Academic/Research,Personal/Life Management,Technical/Engineering]. My focus timeframe is [TIME_HORIZON:select:Today only,This week,This month,This quarter].

[SUPPORT_RESOURCES?]

Please analyze each task and place it into one of four quadrants based on urgency and importance. Be honest and critical in your assessment. Tasks that feel urgent often are not truly important, and important tasks often get pushed aside because they lack deadlines. Force an honest evaluation rather than marking everything as urgent.

For each task, provide your reasoning for its placement, estimate the time needed to complete it, and give one specific immediate next action.

Format your response as a visual matrix with these four sections:

DO FIRST (Urgent and Important): Tasks with real deadlines or consequences that also have significant impact on my goals. These need immediate attention.

SCHEDULE (Important but Not Urgent): Tasks that matter for long-term success but have no pressing deadline. These need protected time on the calendar.

DELEGATE (Urgent but Not Important): Tasks that have deadlines or time pressure but could be handled by someone else or automated. Include who or what could handle these.

ELIMINATE OR DEFER (Neither Urgent nor Important): Tasks that feel like work but do not actually move things forward. Be direct about what to drop or push to later.

After the matrix, provide a one-sentence summary of what I should focus on first and why.
