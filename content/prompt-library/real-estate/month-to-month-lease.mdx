Create a professional month-to-month lease agreement that opens with a clear title identifying it as a Month-to-Month Residential Lease Agreement, followed by the effective date and state jurisdiction. Begin with a preamble establishing that this document constitutes a legally binding agreement between the landlord and tenant for the rental of residential property on a month-to-month basis.

Present the parties section identifying the landlord and tenant by their full legal names and contact information. Follow with a complete property description including the full address, property type, and any included amenities, parking, or storage.

Detail the lease term section emphasizing the month-to-month nature of the tenancy, the commencement date, the automatic renewal each month, and the specific notice requirements for termination by either party. Make clear that either party may terminate the tenancy by providing the specified written notice before the end of any monthly period.

Include comprehensive rent provisions covering the monthly amount, due date, acceptable payment methods, grace period if any, late fees, and the process and notice period required for rent increases. Address what happens if rent is not received, including any returned payment fees.

Draft a security deposit section explaining the amount, how it will be held, permitted deductions, and the timeline and process for return after move-out. Include language about the move-in and move-out inspection process.

Address utilities and services, clearly delineating which are included in rent and which are the tenant's responsibility to establish and pay.

Include maintenance and repair provisions outlining the landlord's obligations to maintain habitability and the tenant's responsibilities for cleanliness and reporting issues. Specify response times for repairs and the process for requesting maintenance.

Cover rules and policies including pet restrictions, guest limitations, subletting prohibitions, smoking rules, noise and nuisance provisions, and any other property-specific rules.

Include a right of entry section specifying the circumstances under which the landlord may enter and the notice required.

Add an insurance section addressing renters insurance requirements or recommendations.

Include standard legal provisions covering governing law, severability, entire agreement, amendments, and the binding nature of the agreement on heirs, successors, and assigns.

Create signature blocks for the landlord and all named tenants with spaces for printed names, signatures, and dates. Include an acknowledgment that each party has received a copy of the signed agreement.

Conclude with an important notice stating that this document is provided as a template for informational purposes and that landlord-tenant laws vary significantly by state and locality. Both parties are strongly advised to consult with a licensed attorney in their jurisdiction before signing to ensure the agreement complies with all applicable laws and adequately protects their interests. This notice should remind users that local ordinances, rent control laws, and state statutes may impose additional requirements or limitations not addressed in this general template.

Format the document professionally with clear paragraph breaks, consistent formatting, and adequate space for all required signatures. The agreement should be comprehensive yet readable, avoiding overly dense legal language while maintaining the precision necessary for a binding rental agreement.
