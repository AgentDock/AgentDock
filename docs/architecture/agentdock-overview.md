# AgentDock: Build Anything with AI Agents

AgentDock is an open-source, backend-first framework for building and deploying sophisticated AI agents. It's designed to be framework-agnostic and provider-independent, giving you complete control over your agent's implementation.

## Core Architecture

The framework is built around a powerful node-based system:

- **AgentNode**: The primary abstraction for agent functionality, encapsulating LLM interaction and tool integration
- **BaseNode**: The foundation for all nodes, providing core functionality and a consistent interface
- **Node Registry**: Central system for registering and retrieving all node types, including both regular nodes and tools
- **Tool Registry**: Focused abstraction for managing tool availability for agents, working with the Node Registry
- **Custom Tools**: Specialized nodes that can be called by LLMs to perform specific tasks
- **Configuration**: Simple JSON-based agent definitions

### Registry Relationship

The Node Registry and Tool Registry work together to provide a comprehensive system for managing nodes and tools:

- **Node Registry**: Handles the broader node ecosystem, including registration, creation, metadata, and versioning
- **Tool Registry**: Provides a focused interface specifically for making tools available to agents
- **Tools as Nodes**: Tools are registered in the Node Registry with the `isTool` flag set to `true`
- **Dual Purpose**: This architecture supports both the current OSS implementation and the future Pro implementation

## What You Can Build

1. **AI-Powered Applications**
   - Custom chatbots with any frontend
   - Command-line AI assistants
   - Automated data processing pipelines
   - Backend service integrations

2. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Any AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Any frontend framework
   - Any backend service
   - Custom data sources and APIs

3. **Automation Systems**
   - Data processing workflows
   - Document analysis pipelines
   - Automated reporting systems
   - Task automation agents

## Key Features

- üîå **Framework Agnostic**: Use with any tech stack
- üß© **Modular Design**: Build complex systems from simple nodes
- üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible**: Create custom nodes for any functionality
- üîí **Secure**: Built-in security features for API keys and data
- üì¶ **Self-Contained**: Core framework has minimal dependencies

## Getting Started
