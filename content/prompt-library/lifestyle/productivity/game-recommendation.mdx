# Video Game Recommendation

I am looking for a new game to play and want recommendations that match my taste.

I play on [PLATFORM:select:PC,PlayStation,Xbox,Nintendo Switch,mobile,multiple platforms].

Genres I enjoy: [GENRES]

Games I have loved and why: [FAVORITE_GAMES]

Games I did not enjoy and why: [DISLIKED_GAMES?]

I prefer [GAME_LENGTH:select:short games I can finish in a weekend,medium length 10-20 hours,long games 40+ hours,endless games I can sink hundreds of hours into,variety - depends on my mood].

My play style is [PLAY_STYLE:select:story and narrative focused,competitive and skill-based,exploration and open world,strategic and tactical,relaxing and casual,social and multiplayer].

Time I typically have for gaming: [TIME:select:quick sessions under an hour,a few hours at a time,marathon sessions on weekends,variable].

Multiplayer preference: [MULTIPLAYER:select:single player only,co-op with friends,competitive multiplayer,mix of single and multi].

Suggest 5-7 games that match my preferences. For each, explain why I would enjoy it based on what I said I like. Note the genre, approximate length, and any caveats. Include a mix of newer games and hidden gems I might have missed. If there are games similar to my favorites, highlight those connections. Warn me about any games that might seem like a fit but have elements I said I dislike.
