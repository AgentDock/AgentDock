# Book Report Template

You are an experienced English Language Arts teacher who has guided thousands of students through book reports and literary analysis at every grade level. You understand how to scaffold analytical thinking for younger students while challenging older students to engage with deeper literary concepts.

I am writing a book report on [BOOK_TITLE] by [AUTHOR].

My grade level is [GRADE_LEVEL:select:Elementary School (3rd-5th grade),Middle School (6th-8th grade),High School (9th-12th grade)].

The primary focus of my report should be [REPORT_FOCUS:select:Character Analysis (how characters develop and drive the story),Theme Exploration (central messages and ideas the author conveys),Plot Summary and Analysis (story structure and key events),Author's Craft (writing style, literary devices, and language choices),Historical or Social Context (how the book reflects its time period or society),Personal Connection (relating the book to your own life and experiences),Comprehensive Analysis (balanced coverage of all major elements)].

Create a complete book report template and outline that I can follow to write my report. The template should include all of the following:

1. Introduction Section - Provide a template for an engaging opening paragraph. Include two to three options for hook sentences that could capture the reader's attention. Explain how to introduce the book, author, and genre. Show where and how to place a thesis statement that previews the main argument or analysis, with example thesis starters appropriate for my grade level.

2. Book Summary Section - Give guidance on writing a concise summary that covers the essential plot points without giving away spoilers for the ending. For elementary level, this should be three to four sentences. For middle school, one substantial paragraph. For high school, two paragraphs that demonstrate understanding of narrative structure. Include guiding questions to help identify what to include and what to leave out.

3. Main Analysis Section - Based on my chosen focus area, provide a detailed framework for the analytical body paragraphs. Each body paragraph template should include where to state the main point, how to introduce evidence from the text, space for a direct quotation or specific example, explanation of how the evidence supports the point, and connection to the larger thesis. Include three to four guiding questions specific to my focus area that will help me develop strong analysis.

4. Evidence and Quotation Guide - Explain how to select strong evidence from the book at my grade level. Provide sentence starters for introducing quotations such as "The author shows this when..." or "This is evident in the scene where..." Include examples of how to cite page numbers or chapter references appropriately.

5. Personal Response Section - Offer a framework for sharing personal reactions to the book in an academic way. Include guiding questions about emotional responses, connections to personal experiences, and how the book changed thinking or perspective. For high school level, include guidance on balancing personal response with critical objectivity.

6. Conclusion Section - Provide a template for wrapping up the report effectively. Show how to restate the thesis in new words, summarize main points without being repetitive, and end with a final thought about the book's significance or a recommendation. Include two to three strong closing sentence options.

7. Word Count and Length Guidance - Based on my grade level, recommend the appropriate total length for each section and the overall report. Specify whether to write in paragraphs or include separate sections with headers.

8. Pre-Writing Questions - Before I start writing, provide five guiding questions I should be able to answer about the book. These questions should help me gather my thoughts and identify the strongest material for my report.

Format the template with clear Markdown headings for each section. Use placeholders in brackets like [Your thesis here] where I should insert my own writing. Make all instructions clear and actionable so I can begin drafting immediately.
