# Debt Payoff Planner

I want to create a plan to pay off my debt strategically and efficiently.

My debts are: [DEBT_LIST] (for each debt include type, balance, interest rate, and minimum payment)

My monthly take-home income is [MONTHLY_INCOME].

Amount I can put toward debt above minimum payments: [EXTRA_PAYMENT]

My preferred payoff strategy: [STRATEGY:select:debt avalanche highest interest first,debt snowball smallest balance first,unsure recommend one,balance transfer or consolidation options].

My biggest challenge with debt payoff: [CHALLENGE:select:staying motivated,unexpected expenses,not enough extra money,too many accounts to track,high interest eating my payments].

Do I have an emergency fund? [EMERGENCY_FUND:select:yes at least 1000,partially,no nothing saved].

Create a complete debt payoff plan that prioritizes my debts in the optimal order, calculates when each debt will be paid off, shows total interest I will pay with this plan, includes a month-by-month payment schedule, suggests ways to accelerate payoff, and addresses my specific challenge. Compare different strategies if I am unsure which to use. Include motivational milestones to celebrate along the way.
