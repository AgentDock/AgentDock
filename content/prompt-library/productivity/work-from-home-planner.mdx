# Work From Home Planner

You are a remote work strategist who has helped thousands of professionals build sustainable, productive routines for working from home. You understand that WFH success requires more than just a schedule. It demands intentional boundaries, energy management, and strategies for the unique challenges of home environments like isolation, distractions, and the blurring of work and personal life.

I need you to create a personalized work-from-home plan that actually works for my situation.

My remote work setup is [SETUP_TYPE:select:Fully remote (100% from home),Hybrid (some office days),Flexible remote (varying locations),New to remote work (less than 6 months)].

My home environment includes [HOME_SITUATION:select:Living alone,Living with partner or roommates,Living with children at home,Multigenerational household,Shared workspace or co-living]. This affects potential distractions, noise levels, and when I can schedule deep work versus collaborative calls.

My dedicated workspace is [WORKSPACE_TYPE:select:Private home office with door,Dedicated desk in shared room,Kitchen table or flexible space,Multiple spots depending on task,No fixed workspace yet].

I typically work during [WORK_HOURS_START] to [WORK_HOURS_END], though my team is distributed across [TIME_ZONES:select:Same time zone,1-3 hour spread,4-6 hour spread,Global (8+ hour differences),No fixed team hours].

My biggest WFH challenge right now is [PRIMARY_CHALLENGE:select:Staying focused with home distractions,Overworking and knowing when to stop,Feeling isolated from colleagues,Managing household responsibilities alongside work,Video call fatigue and back-to-back meetings,Maintaining energy without commute transitions,Separating work and personal headspace].

My typical meeting load is [MEETING_LOAD:select:Light (0-2 hours daily),Moderate (2-4 hours daily),Heavy (4-6 hours daily),Overwhelming (6+ hours daily)].

Household responsibilities I need to integrate include: [HOUSEHOLD_TASKS]. List things like package deliveries, school pickup, pet care, meal prep, or shared childcare windows.

For my work, I need focused time for: [FOCUS_WORK]. Describe tasks requiring deep concentration such as writing, coding, analysis, creative work, or strategic planning.

I feel most energized and focused during [PEAK_ENERGY:select:Early morning before 9am,Mid-morning 9am to noon,Early afternoon noon to 3pm,Late afternoon 3pm to 6pm,Evening after 6pm].

My current morning routine is [MORNING_ROUTINE?]. Share what you do between waking and starting work, or note that you lack a consistent routine.

My current end-of-day transition is [END_ROUTINE?]. Describe how you currently signal that work is done, or note that work tends to bleed into personal time.

Any specific goals or constraints for this plan: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?].

Create my personalized work-from-home plan including these components:

Start with an environment audit that identifies three immediate improvements I could make to my workspace and suggests ways to signal to household members when I am in deep focus versus available.

Design a daily rhythm template that maps my energy levels to task types, schedules deep work during my peak hours, batches meetings into specific windows where possible, and creates dedicated household task windows so personal responsibilities do not interrupt focused work.

Include transition rituals to replace the commute. Create a morning startup sequence of 10-20 minutes that helps me mentally arrive at work, and an evening shutdown routine that signals work is complete and allows cognitive detachment.

Build in connection strategies to combat isolation. Suggest specific touchpoints like virtual coffee chats, Slack check-ins, or walking meetings that maintain social bonds without adding excessive meeting time.

Address my primary challenge directly with three tactical solutions I can implement immediately, plus one habit to build over the next 30 days.

Create a meeting management strategy based on my meeting load. Include guidance on which meetings could be asynchronous, how to batch synchronous calls, and how to protect recovery time between video calls.

Provide an energy maintenance plan with specific recommendations for movement breaks, meal timing, screen breaks for eye health, and maintaining physical energy without the natural transitions that office life provides.

Format your response as a practical playbook with clear sections, specific time blocks, and actionable rituals. Include approximate durations for each recommendation. Prioritize sustainability over intensity. The best WFH routine is one I will actually follow consistently, not an idealized schedule that burns me out within a week.

End with a 7-day implementation roadmap showing which elements to introduce on which days, building toward the complete routine gradually rather than attempting to change everything at once.
