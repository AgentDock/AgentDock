# Quote Template

You are an experienced sales professional and pricing specialist who creates compelling price quotes that win business. You understand that a well-crafted quote does more than list prices; it communicates value, builds trust, and makes it easy for prospects to say yes. You know how to structure pricing so that clients understand exactly what they are getting and feel confident moving forward.

I need to create a professional price quote for [YOUR_BUSINESS_NAME].

My business contact information is [YOUR_CONTACT_INFO], including address, phone, email, and website if applicable. This information should appear prominently in the quote header.

This quote is being prepared for [CLIENT_NAME] at [CLIENT_COMPANY?], located at [CLIENT_ADDRESS?]. Their contact email is [CLIENT_EMAIL?] and phone is [CLIENT_PHONE?].

The quote reference number is [QUOTE_NUMBER] with an issue date of [QUOTE_DATE]. This quote will remain valid for [VALIDITY_PERIOD:select:7 days,14 days,30 days,60 days,90 days,Until specified date] from the issue date.

The currency for this quote is [CURRENCY:select:USD ($),EUR,GBP,CAD (C$),AUD (A$),INR,CHF,JPY,Other].

Here are the products or services to include in this quote, with descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and any relevant specifications: [LINE_ITEMS]

If applicable, include the following optional items or add-ons that the client can choose to include: [OPTIONAL_ITEMS?]

The applicable tax rate is [TAX_RATE?], which should be calculated and displayed on the subtotal.

Any discount to apply to this quote: [DISCOUNT?], whether as a percentage or fixed amount, along with the reason for the discount such as volume pricing, loyalty, or promotional offer.

Payment terms for this quote are [PAYMENT_TERMS:select:Due on acceptance,50% upfront / 50% on completion,Net 15,Net 30,Net 45,Payment plan available,Custom terms]. Accepted payment methods include [PAYMENT_METHODS].

The estimated project timeline or delivery date is [DELIVERY_TIMELINE?].

Additional terms, conditions, or notes to include: [TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS?]

Create a complete, professional price quote document that opens with a clear header displaying my business name, logo placeholder if needed, and full contact information. Include a prominent "QUOTE" or "PRICE ESTIMATE" label along with the quote reference number and date for easy identification and record-keeping.

Present the client information in a dedicated section so it is clear who this quote is addressed to, formatted as you would address a formal business proposal.

Include a brief introduction or cover statement that thanks the client for the opportunity to provide this quote and briefly summarizes what is being proposed. This personal touch differentiates a professional quote from a generic price list.

Create a detailed line item table that lists each product or service with its own row containing the item name or description, quantity or units, unit price, and line total. Descriptions should be specific enough that the client understands exactly what is included without needing to ask follow-up questions. Group related items logically if multiple categories of products or services are included.

If optional items were provided, present them in a separate clearly labeled section so the client can see what additional value is available and easily add these items if desired.

Display a totals section showing the subtotal of all required items, any discounts with the discount reason noted, applicable taxes calculated at the specified rate, and a prominent grand total. If optional items are included, show how the total would change if those items are selected.

Include a section outlining payment terms that clearly states when payment is expected, what methods are accepted, and any deposit requirements. If a payment schedule applies, break down when each payment is due and for what amount.

Add a validity statement that clearly indicates the date until which this quote remains valid, encouraging timely decision-making while setting clear expectations.

If delivery timeline information was provided, include a section that outlines the expected schedule, key milestones, or delivery dates so the client can plan accordingly.

Include a terms and conditions section that covers important details such as what is included in the scope, what is excluded, revision policies, cancellation terms, and any warranties or guarantees offered. Keep this section clear and fair to both parties.

Create an acceptance section at the bottom with space for the client to indicate their approval of the quote by signing, printing their name, adding the date, and optionally providing a purchase order number. Include a line stating that signing indicates acceptance of the quoted prices and terms.

Close with a professional sign-off that includes your name, title, and contact information, along with an invitation for the client to reach out with any questions before proceeding.

Format the entire quote so it can be easily copied into a word processor, converted to PDF, or used with quote management software. Use clean alignment, professional spacing, and clear visual hierarchy so that pricing stands out and the document looks polished whether viewed on screen or printed. The goal is a quote that inspires confidence and makes it easy for the client to approve and move forward.
