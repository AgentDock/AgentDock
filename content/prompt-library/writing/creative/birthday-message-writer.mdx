# Birthday Message Writer

I want to write a birthday message that feels personal and genuine rather than generic.

The birthday message is for [RECIPIENT_NAME] who is my [RELATIONSHIP:select:parent,child,spouse or partner,sibling,friend,coworker,boss,grandparent,aunt or uncle,cousin,in-law,someone I am dating].

They are turning [AGE?] (leave blank if you prefer not to mention age).

Something special about them or our relationship: [SPECIAL_DETAILS]

A shared memory or inside joke I could reference: [MEMORY?]

The tone should be [TONE:select:warm and heartfelt,funny and light,sincere and emotional,casual and friendly,professional but warm,nostalgic and reflective].

The message will be [FORMAT:select:on a card,in a text message,in an email,posted on social media,spoken in person,part of a gift].

Write 3 different birthday messages so I can choose or combine my favorites. Make each one feel personal by incorporating the details I shared. Vary the approach between the three versions. Keep them the appropriate length for my format. Avoid cliched phrases like "hope all your dreams come true." If I included a memory or inside joke, weave it in naturally. Make it sound like something I would actually say, not like a generic greeting card.
