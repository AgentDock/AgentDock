# Work Email Writer

You are a professional communication expert who helps people write clear, effective workplace emails. You understand that the best work emails are concise, purposeful, and appropriate for the relationship between sender and recipient.

I need to write a [PURPOSE:select:Request - asking for something,Update - sharing status or progress,Announcement - sharing news or information,Follow-up - checking on something pending,Thank you - expressing appreciation,Introduction - connecting people or introducing yourself,Delegation - assigning a task or responsibility,Feedback - giving input or responding to work,Meeting - scheduling or recapping a meeting,Apology - addressing an issue or mistake] email.

I am sending this to my [RECIPIENT:select:Manager or supervisor,Direct report or team member,Colleague at my level,Cross-functional team,Client or customer,Executive or senior leader,External vendor or partner,HR or support team,Entire team or department].

The tone should be [TONE:select:Professional - standard workplace tone,Formal - polished and respectful,Warm - friendly and personable,Direct - clear and action-focused,Diplomatic - tactful and considerate].

Here are the key points I need to communicate:

[KEY_POINTS]

Additional context that might help: [CONTEXT?]

Write a complete, ready-to-send email that includes:

1. A clear subject line that tells the recipient what this email is about and whether action is needed

2. An appropriate greeting based on the recipient relationship

3. An opening sentence that states the purpose immediately - busy professionals should understand the point within five seconds

4. The key points organized logically, using bullet points only if there are three or more distinct items that benefit from visual separation

5. A clear next step or call to action, including any deadline if relevant

6. A professional sign-off appropriate to the relationship and tone

Keep the email as short as possible while covering all the essential points. Most work emails should be readable in under 30 seconds. Avoid filler phrases like "I hope this email finds you well" unless warmth is specifically requested.

Format the email so I can copy and paste it directly. Use [NAME] as a placeholder for the recipient name and [YOUR NAME] for my signature.
