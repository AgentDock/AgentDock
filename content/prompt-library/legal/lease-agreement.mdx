# Lease Agreement Generator

You are an experienced real estate attorney who has drafted thousands of lease agreements for residential landlords, commercial property owners, and room-rental situations. You understand the critical importance of clear, enforceable lease terms that protect both parties while complying with local landlord-tenant laws.

I need you to draft a comprehensive lease agreement for a [PROPERTY_TYPE:select:residential,commercial,room-rental] property.

The property is located at [PROPERTY_ADDRESS], which includes [PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION?].

The landlord information is [LANDLORD_INFO], including full legal name, mailing address, email, and phone number.

The tenant information is [TENANT_INFO], including full legal name, current address, email, and phone number.

The lease term is [LEASE_TERM] beginning on [LEASE_START_DATE].

The monthly rent is [RENT_AMOUNT], due on the [RENT_DUE_DAY?] of each month. If rent is late, a fee of [LATE_FEE?] will apply.

The security deposit is [SECURITY_DEPOSIT].

This property is located in [JURISDICTION], so ensure the agreement complies with applicable landlord-tenant laws for this jurisdiction.

Regarding utilities, the arrangement is [UTILITIES_ARRANGEMENT?].

The pet policy is [PET_POLICY?].

Parking arrangements are [PARKING?].

Additional terms or restrictions to include are [ADDITIONAL_TERMS?].

Draft a complete, professional lease agreement that includes all of the following sections:

1. Parties and recitals identifying the landlord and tenant with complete contact information

2. Premises description with the full property address and any included features, appliances, or furnishings

3. Term of lease with exact start and end dates, plus any renewal or extension provisions

4. Rent payment terms including the amount, due date, acceptable payment methods, grace period if any, and late fee structure

5. Security deposit amount with conditions for deductions and timeline for return after lease termination per local law

6. Utilities section specifying which party is responsible for each utility service

7. Use of premises clause defining permitted use and any restrictions on business activities, occupancy limits, or alterations

8. Maintenance and repairs section clarifying landlord and tenant responsibilities for upkeep, repairs, and property condition

9. Rules and regulations including noise restrictions, guest policies, smoking policy, and any community rules

10. Landlord access provisions with required notice period for inspections, repairs, and showings

11. Insurance requirements for both parties if applicable

12. Default and remedies section outlining what constitutes a breach and the consequences for each party

13. Termination provisions including required notice period, early termination conditions, and move-out procedures

14. Governing law clause specifying the jurisdiction

15. Signature blocks for all parties with date lines

Format the agreement with clear section headings, numbered paragraphs for easy reference, and professional legal language that is still readable by non-lawyers. Include blank lines for signatures and dates.

Add a brief disclaimer at the end noting that this agreement should be reviewed by a licensed attorney in the applicable jurisdiction before execution, as laws vary and this template may need modification for full compliance.
