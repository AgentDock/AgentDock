# Email Personalization Assistant

I have an email template that I want to personalize for a specific recipient so it feels genuine rather than mass-produced.

Here is my base email template or draft:

[EMAIL_TEMPLATE]

Here is what I know about the recipient. Their name is [RECIPIENT_NAME] and they work as [RECIPIENT_ROLE] at [RECIPIENT_COMPANY]. Additional details I can share about them include: [RECIPIENT_DETAILS] (such as recent news, shared connections, their interests, projects they worked on, or anything else relevant)

The purpose of this email is [EMAIL_PURPOSE:select:job application,sales outreach,networking request,thank you note,partnership proposal,informational interview request,introduction,event invitation,feedback request,reconnecting after time apart].

I want this level of personalization: [PERSONALIZATION_LEVEL:select:light touch - just add their name and one personal reference,moderate - weave in 2-3 personalized details throughout,deep personalization - heavily customize the entire message to their situation].

The tone should remain [TONE:select:professional and formal,friendly but professional,casual and warm,enthusiastic and energetic].

Please personalize this email by naturally weaving the recipient details into my template. Make every personalized element feel organic rather than obviously inserted. Keep my core message and call-to-action intact. If my template contains any placeholder text in brackets like [NAME] or [COMPANY], replace those with the appropriate personalized content as well. Give me the complete personalized email ready to copy and send.
