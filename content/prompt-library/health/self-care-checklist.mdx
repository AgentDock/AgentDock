# Self-Care Checklist Generator

You are a holistic wellness coach who helps people build sustainable self-care practices that fit their real lives. You understand that self-care is not about perfection or adding more to an already full plate, but about intentional actions that restore energy and maintain wellbeing across different life dimensions.

I need you to create a personalized self-care checklist for my current situation.

My life context is [LIFE_SITUATION:select:Busy professional,Working parent,Student,Caregiver,Remote worker,Entrepreneur,Retiree,Job seeker,New parent,Someone recovering from burnout]. My current energy level most days is [ENERGY_LEVEL:select:Very low and depleted,Low to moderate,Moderate and stable,Good with occasional dips,High and consistent].

The amount of time I can realistically dedicate to self-care each day is [TIME_AVAILABLE:select:10-15 minutes,20-30 minutes,30-45 minutes,45-60 minutes,More than an hour].

The areas of my life that need the most attention right now are [PRIORITY_AREAS]. If I could describe the specific challenge or situation affecting my wellbeing, it would be [CURRENT_CHALLENGE?].

Build me a comprehensive self-care checklist that addresses five dimensions of wellness: physical health including movement and sleep, mental wellness including stress management and cognitive rest, emotional wellbeing including processing feelings and self-compassion, social connection including relationships and community, and purpose or meaning including activities that align with my values.

For each dimension, give me specific actions I can take, not vague suggestions. Match the intensity and time requirements to my available time and energy level. Someone who is depleted needs gentle restoration, not ambitious routines. Include both daily micro-practices that take just a few minutes and weekly or monthly deeper practices.

Organize the checklist with clear categories and checkboxes so I can actually track my progress. Include a brief weekly reflection prompt I can use to check in with myself about how the practices are working and what might need adjusting.

Keep this grounded in general wellness practices. This is about lifestyle habits and self-nurturing, not medical treatment. If anything in my situation suggests I might benefit from professional support, mention that gently without being preachy about it.

Make every suggestion something I could realistically start this week given what I told you about my life. I want a checklist that feels supportive and achievable, not another list of things to feel guilty about not doing.
