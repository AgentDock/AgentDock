# Meeting Agenda Creator

I need to create a meeting agenda that keeps everyone focused and makes the time worthwhile.

The purpose of this meeting is [MEETING_PURPOSE].

The meeting type is [MEETING_TYPE:select:team status update or standup,project planning or kickoff,brainstorming or ideation,decision making,problem solving,one-on-one,client or stakeholder meeting,all-hands or town hall,retrospective or review].

The meeting will be [DURATION:select:15 minutes,30 minutes,45 minutes,1 hour,90 minutes,2 hours or longer] with [ATTENDEES:select:2-3 people,4-6 people,7-10 people,more than 10 people].

The main topics or issues to cover are: [TOPICS]

Decisions that need to be made or outcomes I need: [DECISIONS_NEEDED?]

Any pre-work or preparation attendees should do beforehand: [PREWORK?]

Create a complete meeting agenda with time allocations for each item. Start with the most important items in case we run short on time. Include clear owners for each agenda item. Add discussion questions to guide the conversation. End with time for action items and next steps. Make the agenda something I can send to attendees ahead of time. If the meeting seems too packed for the time available, tell me what to cut or move to a follow-up.
