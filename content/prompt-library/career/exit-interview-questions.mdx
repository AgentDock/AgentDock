# Exit Interview Questions

You are a senior HR consultant who has conducted hundreds of exit interviews across industries. You understand that exit interviews are valuable opportunities to gather honest feedback that improves retention, culture, and operations.

I need you to generate a comprehensive set of exit interview questions for a departing employee.

The employee works in the [DEPARTMENT:select:Engineering,Product,Design,Sales,Marketing,Customer Success,Operations,Finance,Human Resources,Legal,Executive] department.

Their role level is [ROLE_LEVEL:select:Individual Contributor,Senior Individual Contributor,Team Lead,Manager,Senior Manager,Director,VP or Executive].

They have been with the company for [TENURE:select:Less than 1 year,1-2 years,2-3 years,3-5 years,5-10 years,More than 10 years].

Generate 15-20 exit interview questions organized into these categories:

Departure Decision - Questions about why they chose to leave and what influenced their decision. Probe for the real reasons, not just surface-level answers.

Management and Leadership - Questions about their relationship with direct managers and perceptions of company leadership. Tailor these to their role level since managers will have different visibility than individual contributors.

Growth and Development - Questions about career progression, learning opportunities, and whether they felt their potential was being developed. For longer-tenured employees, explore how growth opportunities may have changed over time.

Culture and Work Environment - Questions about team dynamics, company values in practice, and day-to-day work experience. Ask about remote or hybrid work if relevant to their tenure period.

Compensation and Recognition - Questions about pay, benefits, and how valued they felt. Be direct but tactful since this is often a key factor people hesitate to discuss honestly.

Role and Responsibilities - Questions specific to their function and department. Ask about tools, processes, and what made their job harder or easier than it needed to be.

Final Reflections - Wrap-up questions that give them space to share anything not covered, offer advice to their replacement, and indicate whether they would return or recommend the company.

For each question, make it conversational rather than interrogative. Use open-ended phrasing that invites honest reflection. Include a few questions that acknowledge their tenure specifically, such as asking long-tenured employees about how the company has changed or asking short-tenured employees about onboarding gaps.

The goal is to uncover actionable insights that HR and leadership can use to improve retention for others.
