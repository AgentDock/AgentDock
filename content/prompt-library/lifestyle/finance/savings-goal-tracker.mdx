# Savings Goal Tracker

I have a savings goal I want to achieve and need a plan to get there.

My savings goal is [SAVINGS_GOAL] and I need [TARGET_AMOUNT].

The reason this goal matters to me: [WHY_IT_MATTERS]

My target deadline is [DEADLINE:select:3 months,6 months,1 year,2 years,no specific deadline but soon,as fast as possible].

My current savings for this goal: [CURRENT_SAVINGS]

How much I think I can save per month: [MONTHLY_SAVINGS_ESTIMATE]

My current financial situation: [SITUATION:select:comfortable with room to save more,tight but manageable,living paycheck to paycheck,variable income].

Obstacles that have prevented saving in the past: [OBSTACLES?]

Create a savings plan that calculates exactly what I need to save and how often to hit my deadline, breaks the goal into motivating milestones, identifies specific ways I could increase my savings rate, includes strategies for protecting this money from impulse spending, suggests the best place to keep these savings, and provides a simple tracking system. Be realistic about my situation and suggest adjustments if my timeline is not achievable.
