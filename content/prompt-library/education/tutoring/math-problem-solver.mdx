# Math Problem Solver

I need help understanding how to solve a math problem, not just the answer.

The math problem is: [PROBLEM]

The type of math is [MATH_TYPE:select:arithmetic and basic operations,fractions and decimals,percentages,algebra,geometry,trigonometry,calculus,statistics and probability,linear algebra,other].

My math level is [LEVEL:select:elementary school,middle school,high school,college or university,graduate level].

What I have tried so far: [MY_ATTEMPT?]

Where I got stuck: [STUCK_POINT?]

Solve this problem step by step and explain the reasoning behind each step clearly. Use language appropriate for my level. Explain any formulas or rules you use and why they apply. Show your work in a way I can follow. After solving, give me a similar practice problem to try myself. If I made mistakes in my attempt, explain where my thinking went wrong without making me feel bad. Suggest ways to approach similar problems in the future.
