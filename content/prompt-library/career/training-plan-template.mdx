# Training Plan Template

You are a senior learning and development specialist with 15 years of experience designing training programs for organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies. You have created onboarding curricula, upskilling programs, and role transition plans across every industry. Your training plans are known for being practical, measurable, and adaptable to how people actually learn.

I need you to create a comprehensive training plan.

The trainee will be working in the role of [TRAINEE_ROLE].

The key skills and competencies they need to develop are [SKILLS_TO_DEVELOP].

The training period will be [TRAINING_DURATION:select:1 week,2 weeks,30 days,60 days,90 days,6 months].

The trainee learns best through [LEARNING_STYLE:select:Hands-on practice and doing,Reading and self-study,Watching demonstrations and videos,Discussion and collaboration,Structured instruction and lectures,Mixed approach with variety].

Their current experience level coming into this role is [EXPERIENCE_LEVEL:select:No prior experience,Some exposure but not proficient,Experienced in related area,Transferring from similar role].

Any specific constraints, tools they must learn, or context about the team or company: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Based on this information, create a complete training plan that includes:

1. Training Overview - Start with a brief summary of the training goals, the target end state for the trainee, and how this plan accommodates their learning style. State 3-5 specific, measurable objectives that define success.

2. Phase Breakdown - Divide the training period into logical phases. For each phase, include the phase name and duration, the specific skills or knowledge covered, daily or weekly activities broken down by type such as reading, hands-on practice, shadowing, and independent work, the deliverables or outputs the trainee should produce, and the milestone that signals readiness to advance to the next phase.

3. Detailed Schedule - Provide a week-by-week breakdown showing what the trainee should focus on each week, estimated hours per activity type, any dependencies or prerequisites, and who they should work with or shadow during that period.

4. Assessment Checkpoints - Define how progress will be measured at each phase. Include specific tasks or projects that demonstrate competence, questions or scenarios to evaluate understanding, criteria that must be met before moving forward, and how to handle situations where the trainee is not ready to advance.

5. Resources and Materials - List what the trainee will need access to, including documentation, tools, systems, people to shadow, training materials, and any courses or certifications that support the learning objectives.

6. Success Metrics - Define exactly what good looks like at the end of training. Include quantifiable measures where possible, behaviors or capabilities the trainee should demonstrate, how the manager will evaluate readiness for independent work, and a 30-60-90 day check-in structure for after training completes.

7. Adaptation Notes - Include guidance for the manager on how to adjust this plan if the trainee progresses faster or slower than expected, which elements can be compressed if the trainee shows early mastery, and warning signs that indicate the trainee needs additional support.

Format the plan with clear section headers and use tables for schedules and timelines. Write in a tone that is professional but accessible, as if creating a document that both the manager and trainee will reference daily. Be specific about time allocations rather than vague. Every activity should have a clear purpose tied to the learning objectives.
