# Project Management Plan

I need you to create a comprehensive project management plan that I can use to guide execution and present to stakeholders.

The project is called [PROJECT_NAME] and involves [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]. This is a [PROJECT_TYPE:select:software development,marketing campaign,product launch,construction,event planning,business transformation,system implementation,research initiative,consulting engagement,other] project that will run for approximately [DURATION] with a team of [TEAM_SIZE] people.

The primary deliverables for this project include [KEY_DELIVERABLES]. The main stakeholders are [STAKEHOLDERS] and success will be measured by [SUCCESS_CRITERIA].

I want the plan to follow a [METHODOLOGY:select:Agile,Waterfall,Hybrid,Lean,PRINCE2] methodology. [BUDGET_INFO?] [KNOWN_CONSTRAINTS?]

Please structure the project management plan with these sections. Start with an executive summary that captures the project vision, key objectives, and critical success factors in a format suitable for leadership review. Follow this with a detailed scope statement that clearly defines what is included and excluded from the project, along with any assumptions we are making.

For the timeline and milestones section, break the project into logical phases with specific deliverables and target dates for each phase. Include dependencies between major activities. The resource allocation section should outline the team structure, roles and responsibilities, and any external resources or tools required.

Include a risk assessment that identifies potential risks, their likelihood and impact, and specific mitigation strategies for each. The communication plan should specify how and when stakeholders will receive updates, the escalation path for issues, and the cadence for team meetings and status reports.

Conclude with a quality management approach that defines acceptance criteria for deliverables and how quality will be monitored throughout the project.

Format this as a professional document that is ready to present to project sponsors and can serve as the guiding reference throughout project execution.
