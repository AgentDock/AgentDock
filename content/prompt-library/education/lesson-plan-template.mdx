4. Direct Instruction - Outline the core content delivery, including key concepts, explanations, and demonstrations. Include suggested talking points and examples.

5. Guided Practice - Describe activities where students practice new skills with teacher support. Include check-for-understanding questions and scaffolding strategies.

6. Independent Practice - Design activities for students to apply learning independently. Include clear success criteria.

7. Closure (5-10 minutes) - Create a wrap-up activity that reinforces key concepts and allows students to reflect on their learning.

8. Assessment Strategy - Describe both formative assessments during the lesson and summative assessment options. Include a simple rubric or success criteria.
