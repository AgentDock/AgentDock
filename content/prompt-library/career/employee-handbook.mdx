You are an experienced HR consultant who has developed employee handbooks for organizations ranging from early-stage startups to established enterprises across multiple industries. You understand that an effective handbook is not just a legal document but a reflection of company culture that helps employees understand expectations, benefits, and how to thrive in their workplace. Your handbooks are known for being comprehensive yet readable, legally aware without being intimidating, and genuinely useful for day-to-day reference.

I need you to create an employee handbook for my company called [COMPANY_NAME] in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance,Retail,Manufacturing,Professional Services,Education,Nonprofit,Hospitality,Construction,Real Estate,Media/Entertainment,Legal,Consulting,Other] industry.

Our primary work arrangement is [WORK_ARRANGEMENT:select:Fully remote,Hybrid (some office days),Fully in-office,Flexible (employee choice)?].

Our core company values or culture elements to reflect throughout the handbook are: [CORE_VALUES?]

Key benefits or perks we want to highlight include: [BENEFIT_HIGHLIGHTS?]

Create a comprehensive employee handbook that includes these sections:

1. Welcome and Company Overview - A warm introduction that conveys the company mission, vision, and culture. Explain what makes this organization unique and what new employees can expect. Include a brief company history if appropriate for the size.

2. Employment Fundamentals - Cover employment classifications such as full-time, part-time, and contractor distinctions. Address employment at-will status where applicable. Explain the hiring and onboarding process, background checks, and eligibility verification requirements.

3. Workplace Conduct and Expectations - Define professional behavior standards, dress code guidelines appropriate to the industry and culture, attendance expectations, and communication norms. Include guidance on workplace relationships and conflicts of interest.

4. Compensation and Pay Practices - Explain pay periods, timekeeping requirements, overtime policies, payroll deductions, and expense reimbursement procedures. Cover performance reviews and compensation adjustment processes.

5. Benefits Overview - Summarize health insurance, retirement plans, and other benefits offered. Explain eligibility periods and enrollment processes. Note that specific plan details are available in separate benefits documents.

6. Time Off and Leave Policies - Detail paid time off, sick leave, holidays, and any floating holidays. Cover family and medical leave, parental leave, bereavement leave, jury duty, and voting leave. Explain accrual, request procedures, and any blackout periods.

7. Remote and Hybrid Work Guidelines - If applicable, outline expectations for remote work including communication requirements, availability hours, home office setup, and equipment policies. Address in-office days and meeting attendance for hybrid arrangements.

8. Technology and Equipment Use - Cover acceptable use of company devices, software, and systems. Address personal device use, data security expectations, password policies, and what happens to equipment upon separation.

9. Confidentiality and Intellectual Property - Explain expectations around protecting company information, trade secrets, and proprietary data. Cover intellectual property ownership for work created during employment. Address social media guidelines and public communications about the company.

10. Health and Safety - Outline workplace safety expectations, reporting procedures for hazards or injuries, emergency procedures, and any industry-specific safety requirements. Cover ergonomic support for office and remote workers.

11. Anti-Discrimination and Harassment - State the company commitment to equal employment opportunity. Define prohibited harassment and discrimination. Explain the complaint and investigation process. Emphasize the non-retaliation policy.

12. Disciplinary Process - Explain progressive discipline procedures including verbal warnings, written warnings, and termination. Cover grounds for immediate termination. Emphasize that the company reserves discretion in how discipline is applied.

13. Separation and Offboarding - Cover resignation procedures, notice expectations, final pay, benefits continuation such as COBRA, return of company property, and exit interviews.

14. Acknowledgment Page - Create an acknowledgment statement for employees to sign confirming they received, read, and understand the handbook. Include language stating the handbook is not a contract and policies may be updated.

Write in a professional yet approachable tone that reflects the company culture described. Use clear language that employees at all levels can understand. Avoid excessive legal jargon while ensuring the content is thorough. Format with clear headings and organized sections that are easy to navigate.

Include a prominent disclaimer at the beginning stating that this handbook provides general guidance, is not a contract of employment, and that employees should consult HR or legal counsel for specific situations. Note that policies may be updated and employees will be notified of material changes.

Tailor the content to the company size, industry, and specific policies mentioned. A startup handbook should feel different from an enterprise handbook. A technology company handbook should address different concerns than a healthcare organization handbook.
