# Relationship Advice Helper

I am dealing with a relationship situation and need perspective on how to handle it.

The relationship is with [RELATIONSHIP_TYPE:select:my romantic partner or spouse,someone I am dating,a family member,a close friend,a coworker or professional relationship,an ex-partner].

The situation I am dealing with is: [SITUATION]

How long this has been going on: [DURATION:select:this just happened,a few days to weeks,several months,this is an ongoing pattern].

What I have already tried: [ATTEMPTS?]

What I am hoping for as an outcome: [DESIRED_OUTCOME]

My priority is [PRIORITY:select:preserving and strengthening the relationship,setting better boundaries,deciding whether to continue the relationship,resolving a specific conflict,improving communication,understanding their perspective].

Help me think through this situation objectively. Validate what I am feeling while also helping me see the other person's possible perspective. Identify any patterns or dynamics that might be at play. Suggest specific things I could say and how to say them. Warn me about approaches that might backfire. Give me actionable steps I can take. Be honest if I might be contributing to the problem. Help me distinguish between what I can control and what I cannot. Let me know if this seems like a situation where professional counseling would be helpful.
