# Statement of Work Generator

I need to create a Statement of Work for a consulting engagement with [CLIENT_NAME]. The project is titled [PROJECT_TITLE] and falls under [PROJECT_TYPE:select:IT/Technology,Marketing/Communications,Strategy/Advisory,Operations,Financial,HR/Organizational,Legal/Compliance,Research/Analysis,Creative Services,Implementation Support].

Here is the project purpose and background that should be captured in the document: [PROJECT_PURPOSE]

The scope of work encompasses the following tasks and activities: [SCOPE_OF_WORK]

The client expects these specific deliverables: [DELIVERABLES]

The engagement runs from [START_DATE] to [END_DATE]. Key milestones along the way include: [MILESTONES]

Work will be performed [WORK_LOCATION:select:on-site at client location,remotely,hybrid arrangement,at consultant offices]. The consulting team assigned to this project consists of [TEAM_STRUCTURE].

We will measure project success against these criteria: [SUCCESS_CRITERIA]

Budget and payment structure: [BUDGET_INFO?]

We are operating under these assumptions: [ASSUMPTIONS?]

The following items are explicitly excluded from this engagement: [EXCLUSIONS?]

Generate a comprehensive, professional Statement of Work document. Include all standard sections: executive summary, project background and objectives, detailed scope of work, deliverables schedule with due dates, timeline and milestones, roles and responsibilities for both consultant and client, acceptance criteria, pricing and payment terms, change management process for scope modifications, and general terms and conditions. Use formal business language appropriate for a binding agreement. Format with clear section headings and ensure the document could serve as a legal contract between consultant and client.
