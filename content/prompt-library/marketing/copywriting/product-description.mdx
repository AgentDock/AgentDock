# Product Description Writer

I need a product description that sells by connecting features to customer benefits.

The product name is [PRODUCT_NAME].

The product type or category is [PRODUCT_TYPE].

The key features and specifications: [FEATURES]

The target customer is [TARGET_CUSTOMER].

The main benefit or problem it solves: [MAIN_BENEFIT]

What makes it different from alternatives: [DIFFERENTIATOR?]

The price point and positioning: [PRICE_POSITIONING:select:budget friendly value option,mid-range balanced quality and price,premium high quality worth the investment,luxury exclusive and top tier].

Where this will appear: [PLACEMENT:select:ecommerce product page,Amazon listing,social media shop,print catalog,wholesale sheet,marketplace listing].

Desired length: [LENGTH:select:short punchy 50 to 100 words,medium detailed 100 to 200 words,long comprehensive 200 to 400 words,bullet points only].

The tone should be [TONE:select:professional and informative,fun and playful,luxurious and sophisticated,down to earth and practical,technical and detailed].

Write a product description that leads with the most compelling benefit, translates features into customer benefits, paints a picture of the product in use, addresses likely customer questions, and ends with a reason to buy now. If the placement is Amazon or similar, include a title, bullet points, and description section. Make every word work to move the customer closer to purchase.
