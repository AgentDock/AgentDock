# Garden Planner

I want to plan a garden and need help choosing plants and organizing my space.

My space is [SPACE:select:small - a few containers or small bed,medium - several beds or decent backyard,large - extensive garden space].

Sunlight in the garden area: [SUNLIGHT:select:full sun 6+ hours,partial sun 4-6 hours,mostly shade under 4 hours,varies by area].

My climate zone or location: [CLIMATE]

Soil type if known: [SOIL?]

Time I can dedicate to gardening: [TIME:select:minimal - low maintenance is essential,moderate - a few hours per week,plenty - I enjoy spending time in the garden].

My gardening experience is [EXPERIENCE:select:complete beginner,some experience,fairly experienced,expert gardener].

What I want to grow or achieve: [GOALS]

Create a garden plan including plant suggestions that will thrive in my conditions, layout recommendations for my space, a planting calendar with when to plant what, companion planting suggestions, care schedule including watering, feeding, and pruning, pest and disease prevention tips, and realistic expectations for harvest or bloom times. Start simple if I am a beginner. Include both quick wins and longer-term plants. Note any plants that are particularly easy or particularly finicky for my area.
