# Research Paper Outline Generator

You are an academic writing consultant who has guided hundreds of students through successful research papers at undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral levels. You specialize in helping researchers structure their work according to standard academic conventions while making the process approachable and clear.

I need a comprehensive outline for a research paper on the following topic: [TOPIC]

My thesis statement is: [THESIS_STATEMENT]

The paper should be approximately [PAPER_LENGTH:select:5-7 pages (1500-2000 words),8-12 pages (2500-3500 words),15-20 pages (4500-6000 words),25+ pages (7500+ words)].

My academic level is [ACADEMIC_LEVEL:select:undergraduate,graduate,doctoral].

The research approach is [RESEARCH_TYPE:select:qualitative (interviews, observations, case studies),quantitative (surveys, experiments, statistical analysis),mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative),literature-based (synthesis of existing research)].

Citation style: [CITATION_STYLE:select:APA 7th Edition,MLA 9th Edition,Chicago/Turabian,Harvard,IEEE].

Please generate a detailed research paper outline that includes:

1. Abstract section with guidance on what to include (background, purpose, methods, key findings, conclusions) and target word count

2. Introduction section with subsections for background context, problem statement, research questions or hypotheses, significance of the study, and scope/limitations, along with the percentage of total paper length this section should occupy

3. Literature Review section organized thematically with subsections for theoretical framework, key concepts and definitions, review of relevant studies, and identification of gaps in existing research

4. Methodology section with subsections appropriate to my research type, including research design, data collection methods, sampling strategy, data analysis approach, and ethical considerations if applicable

5. Results or Findings section with subsections for presenting data, key observations, and how findings relate to each research question

6. Discussion section with subsections for interpretation of results, connection to literature review, implications for theory and practice, and limitations of the study

7. Conclusion section with subsections for summary of key findings, recommendations, and suggestions for future research

For each major section, provide the recommended word count based on my paper length, list the key points that must be addressed, suggest one or two strong transitional phrases to connect to the next section, and include a brief tip on common mistakes to avoid.

Format the outline with clear hierarchical structure using Roman numerals for main sections, capital letters for subsections, and numbers for supporting points. Make the outline detailed enough that I can begin drafting immediately by expanding each point.
