# AgentDock: Build Anything with AI Agents

AgentDock is an open-source, backend-first framework for building and deploying sophisticated AI agents. It's designed to be framework-agnostic and provider-independent, giving you complete control over your agent's implementation.

## Core Architecture

The framework is built around a powerful node-based system:

- **Core Nodes**: Handle fundamental operations like conversation management and service interactions
- **Custom Nodes**: Extend functionality by creating your own nodes for any specific task
- **Node Registry**: Central system for managing and connecting nodes
- **Configuration**: Simple JSON-based agent definitions

## What You Can Build

1. **AI-Powered Applications**
   - Custom chatbots with any frontend
   - Command-line AI assistants
   - Automated data processing pipelines
   - Backend service integrations

2. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Any AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Any frontend framework
   - Any backend service
   - Custom data sources and APIs

3. **Automation Systems**
   - Data processing workflows
   - Document analysis pipelines
   - Automated reporting systems
   - Task automation agents

## Key Features

- 🔌 **Framework Agnostic**: Use with any tech stack
- 🧩 **Modular Design**: Build complex systems from simple nodes
- 🛠️ **Extensible**: Create custom nodes for any functionality
- 🔒 **Secure**: Built-in security features for API keys and data
- 📦 **Self-Contained**: Core framework has minimal dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Install the framework
2. Create your first agent configuration
3. Add custom nodes for your specific needs
4. Deploy anywhere

## Future Possibilities

- Visual agent builders
- Natural language agent creation
- Advanced agent templates
- Enhanced execution systems
- Managed integrations

AgentDock provides the foundation for building sophisticated AI agent systems while maintaining complete control over your implementation and infrastructure.
