# Out of Office Message Generator

I need to create an out of office auto-reply message that is professional and gives people the information they need while I am away.

I will be out of the office for [REASON:select:vacation or holiday,parental leave,medical leave,business travel,a conference or event,training or professional development,a sabbatical,personal time off].

I am leaving on [START_DATE] and will return on [RETURN_DATE].

During this time, my email access will be [ACCESS_LEVEL:select:none - I will not be checking email at all,limited - I may check occasionally but responses will be delayed,sporadic - I will respond to urgent matters only].

If someone needs immediate assistance while I am away, they should contact: [BACKUP_CONTACT?] (include name and email, or leave blank if no backup needed)

The tone should be [TONE:select:strictly professional and formal,professional but friendly,casual and personable,warm with a touch of humor].

Write an out of office message that clearly communicates when I will be away, when I will return, what to expect regarding response times, and who to contact for urgent matters. Keep it concise and easy to scan quickly. Make sure it sounds like a real person wrote it rather than a generic corporate template.
