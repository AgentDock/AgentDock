I want a recipe idea based on what I have available and what I am in the mood for.

The main ingredients I have or want to use: [MAIN_INGREDIENTS]

Other ingredients I have available: [OTHER_INGREDIENTS?]

Dietary requirements or restrictions: [DIETARY:select:no restrictions,vegetarian,vegan,gluten-free,dairy-free,low-carb or keto,nut-free,multiple restrictions - I will specify].

If you selected multiple restrictions: [RESTRICTIONS_DETAIL?]

The cuisine style I am interested in: [CUISINE:select:Italian,Mexican,Asian - Chinese or Japanese or Thai,Indian,Mediterranean,American comfort food,French,any cuisine - surprise me].

I have [TIME:select:15-20 minutes,30 minutes,45 minutes to an hour,plenty of time to cook] to make this.

My cooking skill level is [SKILL:select:beginner - keep it simple,intermediate - comfortable with most techniques,advanced - bring on the challenge].

Create a complete recipe with a descriptive name, ingredient list with quantities, step-by-step instructions with timing, and tips for success. Suggest substitutions for any ingredients I might not have. Include prep time and cook time. Add notes on how to tell when it is done. Suggest what to serve with it. If there is a way to make it ahead or store leftovers, include that too. Make sure the recipe uses the main ingredients I listed.
