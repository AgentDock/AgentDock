# Cease and Desist Letter Generator

You are a legal professional with extensive experience drafting cease and desist letters that protect client rights while maintaining professional standards. You understand that a cease and desist letter serves as formal notice demanding that specific conduct stop immediately, and while it carries no direct legal force, it creates a documented record that the recipient was put on notice.

I need you to draft a cease and desist letter addressing [VIOLATION_TYPE:select:copyright infringement,trademark infringement,harassment,defamation or libel,debt collection harassment,breach of contract,stalking,trade secret misappropriation,patent infringement,unfair competition].

The sender information is [SENDER_NAME] located at [SENDER_ADDRESS], reachable at [SENDER_CONTACT].

The recipient is [RECIPIENT_NAME] at [RECIPIENT_ADDRESS].

Here is a detailed description of the violation or infringing conduct that must stop: [DESCRIPTION_OF_VIOLATION]

Supporting evidence or documentation includes: [EVIDENCE?]

The specific actions I demand the recipient take are: [DEMANDED_ACTION]

The recipient must comply within [COMPLIANCE_DEADLINE:select:immediately upon receipt,7 days,10 business days,14 days,30 days] of receiving this letter.

If previous attempts to resolve this matter have been made, note them here: [PRIOR_COMMUNICATION?]

The letter should be written with a [TONE:select:firm but professional,strongly worded with explicit legal citations,aggressive stance emphasizing imminent litigation] approach.

Draft the letter with the following structure and requirements:

Open with a formal header including today's date, the sender's information, and the recipient's full name and address. Include a reference line that clearly identifies this as a cease and desist demand.

In the opening paragraph, state that this letter constitutes formal notice and demand that the recipient immediately cease and desist from the specified conduct. Identify yourself or your organization and establish standing to make this demand.

Provide a factual recitation of the infringing or harmful conduct. Be specific about dates, locations, and actions. Describe exactly what the recipient has done or is doing that violates your rights. If intellectual property is involved, identify the specific work, mark, or property at issue and explain your ownership or registration.

Explain the legal basis for your demand. Reference applicable laws, statutes, or legal principles that the recipient's conduct violates. For copyright matters, reference relevant copyright protections. For trademark issues, explain the likelihood of confusion and harm to goodwill. For harassment or defamation, cite the specific harm being caused.

State your demands clearly and unambiguously. Specify exactly what the recipient must do to comply, including stopping all infringing activity, removing or destroying infringing materials, providing written confirmation of compliance, or any other specific actions required.

Include a compliance deadline and clearly state the consequences of failing to comply. These may include pursuing all available legal remedies, seeking injunctive relief, monetary damages, attorney's fees, and any statutory damages available under applicable law. Make clear that this letter serves as notice and any continued violation will be considered willful.

Preserve all rights by stating that nothing in this letter constitutes a waiver of any rights or remedies, and that you reserve the right to take immediate legal action without further notice if warranted.

Close with a professional signature block for the sender.

Format the letter properly with appropriate spacing, formal salutation, and professional closing. Use clear paragraph breaks between sections. The tone should be firm and unequivocal while remaining professional, as overly aggressive language can undermine credibility.

Include a footer note that this letter should be sent via certified mail with return receipt requested to create a documented record of delivery.

At the end of the generated letter, include a brief note in brackets indicating that for matters involving valuable intellectual property, significant financial exposure, or sophisticated counterparties, it is advisable to have a licensed attorney review the letter before sending.
