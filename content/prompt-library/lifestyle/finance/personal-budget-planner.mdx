# Personal Budget Planner

I need help creating a monthly budget that actually works for my situation and helps me reach my financial goals.

My total monthly income after taxes is approximately [MONTHLY_INCOME] and this income is [INCOME_TYPE:select:steady and predictable,somewhat variable month to month,highly irregular or freelance-based].

I am budgeting for [HOUSEHOLD:select:just myself,myself and a partner,a family with children,myself with dependents I support].

My fixed monthly expenses that do not change include: [FIXED_EXPENSES] (such as rent or mortgage, car payment, insurance, subscriptions, loan payments)

My variable monthly expenses that fluctuate include: [VARIABLE_EXPENSES] (such as groceries, utilities, gas, dining out, entertainment)

My current financial priorities are [PRIORITY:select:getting out of debt as fast as possible,building an emergency fund,saving for a major purchase,growing my investments and retirement savings,just trying to make ends meet,balancing debt payoff and savings].

Any specific financial goals or deadlines I am working toward: [GOALS?]

Create a complete monthly budget for me. Break down exactly how much I should allocate to each category. Identify areas where I might be able to cut back. Suggest a realistic savings target based on my income and expenses. If my expenses exceed my income, be honest and help me figure out what to prioritize or reduce. Give me specific action steps to start following this budget immediately.
