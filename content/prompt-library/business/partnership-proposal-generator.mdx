# Partnership Proposal Generator

You are a business development strategist who specializes in crafting partnership proposals that lead to successful collaborations. Your proposals stand out because they demonstrate genuine understanding of both parties' goals, articulate specific mutual benefits, and make it easy for decision-makers to say yes.

I need to create a partnership proposal for my company. My company is [YOUR_COMPANY] and we [YOUR_COMPANY_DESCRIPTION, e.g., "provide cloud-based inventory management software to mid-market retailers"]. I want to propose a partnership with [PARTNER_COMPANY] who [PARTNER_DESCRIPTION, e.g., "operates the largest e-commerce fulfillment network in Southeast Asia"].

The type of partnership I am proposing is [PARTNERSHIP_TYPE:select:Strategic Alliance,Distribution or Channel Partnership,Technology Integration,Co-Marketing or Joint Promotion,Referral or Affiliate Partnership,Licensing Agreement,Joint Venture,Supply Chain Partnership,White-Label Partnership,Research and Development Collaboration].

Our industry is [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Finance and Banking,Retail and E-commerce,Manufacturing,Professional Services,Media and Entertainment,Education,Real Estate,Logistics and Transportation,Energy,Agriculture,Hospitality,Telecommunications].

Here is what we bring to the partnership: [YOUR_VALUE, e.g., "proprietary demand forecasting AI with 94% accuracy, established customer base of 400+ retailers, and technical team experienced in enterprise integrations"].

Here is what we are seeking from them: [THEIR_VALUE, e.g., "access to their fulfillment network APIs, co-selling opportunities with their existing clients, and their regional market expertise"].

The primary objectives we want to achieve together are: [OBJECTIVES, e.g., "reduce stockouts for shared customers by 40%, expand our reach into Southeast Asian markets, and create a turnkey solution for omnichannel retailers"].

Our proposed partnership duration is [DURATION:select:6-month pilot,1-year agreement,2-year agreement,3-year agreement,Open-ended with annual review,Project-based].

Why this partnership makes sense now: [WHY_NOW?, e.g., "They recently announced expansion into three new markets where our technology would add immediate value" or "Our mutual customers have been requesting this integration for months"].

Any existing relationship or connection: [EXISTING_CONNECTION?, e.g., "We share three enterprise customers" or "Met their VP of Partnerships at a recent conference" or "Cold outreach"].

Create a partnership proposal with the following sections:

Executive Summary that hooks the reader in sixty seconds by stating who we are, what we propose, the primary mutual benefit, and the recommended next step. Keep this under 150 words.

About Us section that establishes our credibility quickly without being self-promotional. Focus on capabilities and track record relevant to this specific partnership. Include any social proof such as notable clients, metrics, or recognition.

Why Partner Company section that demonstrates we have done our homework. Reference their recent initiatives, challenges they may face, or strategic priorities where our partnership adds value. Make them feel understood, not pitched at.

The Partnership Opportunity section that presents the core proposal clearly. Describe the partnership model, how it would work in practice, and the scope of initial collaboration. Be specific enough that they can envision it but flexible enough to invite discussion.

Mutual Benefits section with two subsections: benefits for them and benefits for us. For each benefit, include a specific and measurable outcome where possible. Lead with their benefits since that is what they care about most.

Proposed Structure section covering roles and responsibilities for each party, resource commitments expected, key milestones for the first 90 days, governance or communication cadence, and intellectual property or revenue sharing considerations if applicable.

Success Metrics section defining three to five key performance indicators we would track together, how we would measure and report on them, and what success looks like at 6 months and 12 months.

Risk Considerations section that proactively addresses potential concerns they might have and how we would mitigate them. This builds trust by showing we have thought this through.

Proposed Timeline section with a clear path from proposal acceptance to partnership launch, including key milestones and dependencies.

Next Steps section with a specific and low-friction call to action. Suggest a concrete meeting time or decision point rather than a vague request to discuss further.

Write in a professional yet personable tone. Be confident but not arrogant. Make the proposal feel like it was written specifically for this partner, not templated. The total length should be appropriate for a 4 to 6 page document when formatted.
