# Personal Affirmation Generator

I want affirmations that actually resonate with me rather than generic positive statements.

The area of my life I want to focus on is [FOCUS:select:self-confidence and self-worth,career and professional growth,health and body image,relationships and connection,financial abundance,creativity and expression,managing anxiety or stress,overcoming a specific challenge,general positivity and gratitude].

The specific challenge or negative thought pattern I am working on: [CHALLENGE?]

What I want to believe or feel instead: [DESIRED_STATE]

My current mindset toward affirmations is [MINDSET:select:open and ready to embrace them,skeptical but willing to try,find most affirmations too cheesy,looking for something more grounded].

I prefer affirmations that are [STYLE:select:traditional positive statements,more grounded and realistic,questions that prompt reflection,permission-giving statements,action-oriented commitments].

Create 15-20 personalized affirmations addressing my specific focus and challenge. Make them believable enough that I will not roll my eyes. Include a mix of present-tense I am statements, permission-giving statements, and growth-oriented statements. Avoid toxic positivity or denying difficult realities. Explain why each type of affirmation works. Suggest how to use them effectively, such as when and how often. Include tips for making affirmations stick when my brain resists them.
