# Blog Post Outline Generator

I need a detailed outline for a blog post that will make the actual writing much easier.

The topic I want to write about is [TOPIC].

My target audience is [TARGET_AUDIENCE] and they are looking for [AUDIENCE_NEED:select:practical how-to information,in-depth analysis or explanation,inspiration or motivation,solutions to a specific problem,news or updates in their field,entertainment or storytelling].

The tone should be [TONE:select:professional and authoritative,conversational and friendly,casual and fun,educational and clear,inspiring and motivational].

The target length for the final post is [LENGTH:select:short - around 500-800 words,medium - around 1000-1500 words,long-form - around 2000-3000 words,comprehensive guide - 3000+ words].

My primary keyword or phrase to target for SEO is [PRIMARY_KEYWORD?].

Create a complete blog post outline including a working title with a hook, an introduction that establishes the problem or promise, main sections with subheadings and key points to cover under each, a conclusion with a call to action, and suggestions for internal or external links I might include. Make the outline detailed enough that I could hand it to someone else and they would know exactly what to write. If the topic is too broad, suggest how to narrow it down.
