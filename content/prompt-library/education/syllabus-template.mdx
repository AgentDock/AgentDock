# Syllabus Template

You are an experienced curriculum designer and academic administrator who creates clear, comprehensive course syllabi. You understand what students and institutions need from a syllabus and how to structure information for maximum clarity and compliance.

I need a complete course syllabus for [COURSE_NAME]. The course is designed for [LEVEL:select:Elementary School (K-5),Middle School (6-8),High School (9-12),Undergraduate,Graduate,Professional Development,Adult Education,Online Certificate] students. The course runs for [DURATION:select:4 weeks,6 weeks,8 weeks,Quarter (10 weeks),Semester (15-16 weeks),Full year,Summer intensive,Self-paced].

The subject area is [SUBJECT:select:Mathematics,Science,English/Language Arts,Social Studies,History,Foreign Language,Computer Science,Business,Arts,Health/Physical Education,Engineering,Psychology,Other]. The class will meet [SCHEDULE:select:Once per week,Twice per week,Three times per week,Daily,Asynchronous online,Hybrid (online and in-person)].

Here are the primary learning objectives I want students to achieve by the end of this course:

[OBJECTIVES]

Any required textbooks or specific materials to include: [MATERIALS?]

Create a complete, professional syllabus with the following sections:

1. Course Information - Include the course title, a suggested course code format, credit hours or contact hours appropriate for this level, and the meeting schedule. Add placeholder brackets for term/year and section number.

2. Instructor Information - Create a section with placeholders for instructor name, office location, office hours, email, and phone. Include a note about preferred communication method.

3. Course Description - Write a compelling two to three paragraph description that explains what the course covers, why it matters, and how it connects to broader learning goals or career applications.

4. Learning Objectives - Format my provided objectives into clear, measurable statements using action verbs. Each objective should describe what students will be able to do upon completing the course.

5. Required Materials - List textbooks, supplies, technology requirements, and any recommended resources. Include ISBN numbers where applicable or note that instructor will provide details.

6. Grading Policy - Create a detailed breakdown with specific assignment categories, point values or percentages, and a grading scale. Include at least five different assessment types appropriate for this course level and subject.

7. Course Schedule - Develop a complete week-by-week or unit-by-unit schedule covering the entire course duration. For each week, include the topic, readings or assignments due, and any key dates. Leave space for the instructor to add specific dates.

8. Attendance Policy - Write an attendance policy appropriate for this education level. Include expectations for participation, consequences for absences, and procedures for excused absences.

9. Late Work and Make-Up Policy - Describe clear guidelines for late submissions, including any penalties, grace periods, and procedures for extensions. Be specific about documentation requirements.

10. Academic Integrity and AI Policy - Include a statement about honesty, plagiarism, and consequences for violations. Add a specific subsection addressing the use of AI tools and generative AI in coursework, with clear guidelines on what is permitted, what requires citation, and what is prohibited. Reference that students should follow institutional policy and include a placeholder for linking to the official policy.

11. Accessibility and Accommodations - Write an inclusive statement about supporting students with disabilities and how to request accommodations. Include a placeholder for the institution's disability services office.

12. Communication Expectations - Describe how the instructor will communicate with students, expected response times, and how students should reach out with questions or concerns.

Format the syllabus with clear section headers, consistent formatting, and professional language appropriate for this education level. Use tables where they improve readability, particularly for the grading breakdown and course schedule. Include placeholder brackets [like this] wherever the instructor needs to customize information for their specific context.
