# AgentDock: Build Anything with AI Agents

AgentDock is an open-source, backend-first framework for building and deploying sophisticated AI agents. It's designed to be framework-agnostic and provider-independent, giving you complete control over your agent's implementation.

## Core Architecture

The framework is built around a powerful node-based system:

- **AgentNode**: The primary abstraction for agent functionality, encapsulating LLM interaction and tool integration
- **BaseNode**: The foundation for all nodes, providing core functionality and a consistent interface
- **Node Registry**: Central system for registering and retrieving all node types, including both regular nodes and tools
- **Tool Registry**: Focused abstraction for managing tool availability for agents, working with the Node Registry
- **Custom Tools**: Specialized nodes that can be called by LLMs to perform specific tasks
- **Configuration**: Simple JSON-based agent definitions
- **Orchestration Framework**: Dynamic control of agent behavior based on conversation context
- **Session Management**: Isolated state management for concurrent conversations

### Advanced Subsystems

#### Session Management

The [session management system](./sessions/README.md) provides isolation between concurrent conversations and maintains state across multiple requests. Key capabilities include:

- **Stateful Conversations**: Maintain conversation context and history
- **Tool Context Persistence**: Enable tools to store and access stateful information
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized storage with automatic cleanup
- **Single Source of Truth**: Consistent session state across components

For more details, see the [Session Management Overview](./sessions/session-overview.md).

#### Orchestration Framework

The [orchestration framework](./orchestration/README.md) enables dynamic control of agent behavior and tool availability based on conversation context:

- **Context-Aware Steps**: Transition between different modes based on conversation content
- **Dynamic Tool Availability**: Control which tools are available in different steps
- **Conditional Logic**: Activate steps based on message content or previous tool usage
- **Tool Sequences**: Define specific tool ordering for complex workflows

For more details, see the [Orchestration Framework Overview](./orchestration/orchestration-overview.md).

### Registry Relationship

The Node Registry and Tool Registry work together to provide a comprehensive system for managing nodes and tools:

- **Node Registry**: Handles the broader node ecosystem, including registration, creation, metadata, and versioning
- **Tool Registry**: Provides a focused interface specifically for making tools available to agents
- **Tools as Nodes**: Tools are registered in the Node Registry with the `isTool` flag set to `true`
- **Dual Purpose**: This architecture supports both the current OSS implementation and the future Pro implementation
