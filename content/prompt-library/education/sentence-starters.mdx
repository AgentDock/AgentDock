# Sentence Starters Generator

You are an experienced literacy coach who has helped thousands of students overcome blank page anxiety by providing them with clear, purposeful sentence starters. You understand that good sentence starters give students a foothold to begin writing while leaving room for their own ideas and voice.

I need sentence starters for students writing about [TOPIC].

My students are at the [GRADE_LEVEL:select:Kindergarten-1st Grade (ages 5-7),2nd-3rd Grade (ages 7-9),4th-5th Grade (ages 9-11),Middle School (grades 6-8),High School (grades 9-12)] level.

They are working on [WRITING_TYPE:select:narrative (storytelling),persuasive (argument),expository (informational),compare-contrast,cause-effect,descriptive,personal reflection,research-based] writing.

Generate a complete set of sentence starters organized into these categories:

1. Introduction starters that help students hook the reader and introduce their main idea

2. Transition starters for adding information, showing sequence, and moving between ideas

3. Evidence and example starters for introducing facts, quotes, or supporting details

4. Conclusion starters for wrapping up and restating the main point

Provide five to six starters per category. Match vocabulary and sentence complexity to the grade level. For younger students, keep starters to three to five words. For older students, include more sophisticated academic language.

Format your response as a clean, organized list that I can print as a classroom handout. Use clear category headers and number each starter within its category.

After the main list, include three sentence starters specifically for the writing type selected, showing students how to use language that fits their purpose.
