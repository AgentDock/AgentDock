# Focus Session Planner

I need to do focused work and want to set myself up for a productive session.

The task I need to focus on is [TASK].

The type of work is [WORK_TYPE:select:creative or generative,analytical or problem-solving,writing or communication,learning or studying,administrative or processing,coding or technical,strategic or planning].

I have [TIME_AVAILABLE:select:30 minutes,1 hour,90 minutes,2 hours,a full morning or afternoon] for this session.

My current energy level is [ENERGY:select:high and ready to go,moderate,low but need to push through,variable - goes up and down].

My main distractions are [DISTRACTIONS:select:phone and notifications,internet and social media,people interrupting me,internal thoughts and worrying,environment noise or discomfort,task switching and multitasking].

My environment is [ENVIRONMENT:select:quiet home office,busy office with others,coffee shop or public space,shared space with family,varies].

Help me plan this focus session for maximum productivity. Include how to prepare and set up before starting, how to eliminate or manage my specific distractions, the optimal work to break ratio for my time block, what to do if I get stuck or lose focus, how to capture tangential thoughts without derailing, and how to close the session and transition out. Suggest music or audio if helpful for my work type. Include a pre-session ritual to signal deep work mode. Give me permission structures for ignoring distractions guilt-free.
