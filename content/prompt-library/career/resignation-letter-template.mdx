# Resignation Letter Template

I need to write a professional resignation letter.

My current job title is [JOB_TITLE] at [COMPANY_NAME].

My last working day will be [LAST_DAY].

I want the tone to be [TONE:select:Formal and Professional,Warm and Appreciative].

Write a complete resignation letter that includes:

1. A clear statement that I am resigning from my position
2. My confirmed last day of work
3. Gratitude for the opportunities during my time at the company
4. An offer to assist with the transition during my remaining time
5. A professional closing that leaves the door open for future connection

Tone guidance:

For Formal and Professional: Keep it concise and businesslike. Express appreciation briefly without being effusive. Focus on facts and a smooth handoff. Three to four short paragraphs maximum.

For Warm and Appreciative: Include genuine thanks for specific types of growth such as professional development, team relationships, or career opportunities. Be heartfelt while remaining professional. Show that you value the time spent at the company.

Format as a proper business letter ready to print and sign. Include today's date, an appropriate salutation, body paragraphs, and a professional sign-off. Keep the letter to one page.
