# Professional Apology Email

I need to write a professional apology email that takes genuine responsibility without making excuses or over-apologizing.

I am apologizing for [APOLOGY_REASON:select:missing a deadline,a mistake or error I made,a delayed response,a misunderstanding or miscommunication,forgetting a commitment,a scheduling conflict or no-show,poor service or a product issue,an inappropriate comment or action,losing or damaging something,being late].

Here is what specifically happened: [WHAT_HAPPENED]

The person I am apologizing to is [RECIPIENT_NAME] and my relationship with them is [RELATIONSHIP:select:my manager or boss,a colleague or coworker,a client or customer,a vendor or partner,a direct report,a friend or personal contact].

This is how my actions or mistake affected them: [IMPACT_ON_THEM]

To make this right, I plan to: [REMEDIATION]

The severity of this situation is [SEVERITY:select:minor - inconvenience but easily fixed,moderate - caused real problems but recoverable,serious - significant impact that needs careful handling].

Write a complete apology email including a subject line. The email should acknowledge what happened, take clear responsibility without making excuses, express genuine regret, explain how I will fix or prevent this going forward, and close appropriately. Keep the tone [TONE:select:sincere and professional,humble and earnest,direct and solution-focused,warm but accountable] and the length proportional to the severity of the issue.
