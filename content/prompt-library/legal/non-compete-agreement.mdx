# Non-Compete Agreement Generator

You are an experienced employment law attorney who specializes in drafting restrictive covenant agreements for businesses across the United States. You understand that non-compete enforceability varies dramatically by jurisdiction and that overly broad agreements are often struck down by courts. Your approach balances protecting legitimate business interests with creating agreements that are reasonable and likely to be enforceable.

IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Non-compete agreements are NOT enforceable in all jurisdictions. California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Minnesota ban or severely restrict non-competes for employees. The District of Columbia also has significant limitations. Even in states that permit non-competes, courts routinely invalidate agreements they deem unreasonable in scope, duration, or geographic reach. This generated document is a starting point only and MUST be reviewed by a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction before use. Do not rely on this as legal advice.

I need you to draft a non-compete agreement for my business.

The employer is [EMPLOYER_NAME], a company operating in the [EMPLOYER_INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Financial Services,Manufacturing,Retail,Professional Services,Real Estate,Construction,Marketing/Advertising,Hospitality,Education,Other] industry, located at [EMPLOYER_ADDRESS].

The employee or contractor is [EMPLOYEE_NAME], who will serve in the role of [EMPLOYEE_TITLE]. The employment relationship will be governed by the laws of [STATE:select:Alabama,Alaska,Arizona,Arkansas,Colorado,Connecticut,Delaware,Florida,Georgia,Hawaii,Idaho,Illinois,Indiana,Iowa,Kansas,Kentucky,Louisiana,Maine,Maryland,Massachusetts,Michigan,Mississippi,Missouri,Montana,Nebraska,Nevada,New Hampshire,New Jersey,New Mexico,New York,North Carolina,Ohio,Oregon,Pennsylvania,Rhode Island,South Carolina,South Dakota,Tennessee,Texas,Utah,Vermont,Virginia,Washington,West Virginia,Wisconsin,Wyoming].

The agreement should be effective as of [EFFECTIVE_DATE].

The specific activities I want to restrict after employment ends include: [RESTRICTED_ACTIVITIES]

The geographic territory where these restrictions should apply is: [GEOGRAPHIC_SCOPE]

The duration of the non-compete restriction should be [DURATION:select:6 months,12 months,18 months,24 months].

In exchange for signing this non-compete, the employee will receive the following consideration: [CONSIDERATION:select:Initial employment offer,Continued employment,Promotion or raise,Signing bonus,Stock options or equity,Access to proprietary training,Severance package,Other specified compensation]

Additional details about the consideration if applicable: [CONSIDERATION_DETAILS?]

The types of confidential information and trade secrets the employee will have access to include: [CONFIDENTIAL_INFO_TYPES]

Any specific competitors or competing businesses to be named in the agreement: [NAMED_COMPETITORS?]

Generate a complete non-compete agreement that includes the following sections:

1. Recitals section establishing the business relationship and the legitimate business interests being protected

2. Definitions section clearly defining key terms including Confidential Information, Competing Business, Restricted Activities, and Restricted Territory

3. Non-compete covenant stating the specific restrictions, making them narrow enough to be enforceable while protecting genuine business interests

4. Non-solicitation provisions covering both clients/customers and fellow employees

5. Confidentiality obligations that survive the employment relationship

6. Consideration acknowledgment confirming what the employee receives in exchange for these restrictions

7. Reasonableness acknowledgment where the employee agrees the restrictions are reasonable and necessary

8. Remedies section specifying injunctive relief and other enforcement mechanisms available to the employer

9. Severability clause allowing courts to modify overly broad provisions rather than void the entire agreement

10. Choice of law and venue provisions specifying which state laws govern the agreement

11. Integration clause confirming this is the complete agreement on this subject

12. Signature blocks for both parties with date lines

Format the agreement with clear section headings, numbered paragraphs where appropriate, and professional legal formatting. Use plain language where possible while maintaining legal precision. Include blanks or brackets for any information that needs to be filled in at signing.

At the end of the agreement, provide a brief summary of enforceability considerations specific to the selected state, including any unique requirements or recent changes in that jurisdiction's treatment of non-compete agreements.
