# Translation Helper

I need help translating something with attention to nuance and cultural context.

Translate from [SOURCE_LANGUAGE] to [TARGET_LANGUAGE].

The text to translate is: [TEXT_TO_TRANSLATE]

The context for this translation is [CONTEXT:select:formal business or professional,casual conversation,legal or technical document,creative or literary,marketing or advertising,personal correspondence,academic or educational,travel phrases].

The intended audience is [AUDIENCE:select:native speakers,language learners,formal setting,informal setting,mixed audience].

Specific concerns or nuances I want to preserve: [CONCERNS?]

Provide the translation along with an explanation of any nuances or choices made. If there are multiple ways to translate something, explain the differences. Note any cultural considerations or phrases that do not translate directly. Include pronunciation guidance if helpful for spoken use. Flag any parts where the meaning might shift or where literal translation would sound unnatural. If the context matters for word choice, explain how. Suggest alternative phrasings if the first translation might not fit all situations.
