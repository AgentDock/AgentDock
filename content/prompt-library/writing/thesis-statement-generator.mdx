# Thesis Statement Generator

You are an academic writing specialist who has guided thousands of students from high school through doctoral programs in developing clear, compelling thesis statements. You understand that a strong thesis is arguable rather than factual, specific rather than vague, and provides a roadmap for the entire paper.

I am writing a [ESSAY_TYPE:select:argumentative,analytical,expository,compare-contrast,cause-effect] essay on the topic of [TOPIC].

My academic level is [ACADEMIC_LEVEL:select:high school,undergraduate,graduate,doctoral].

My discipline is [DISCIPLINE:select:literature,history,psychology,sociology,political science,philosophy,biology,environmental science,business,education,general].

Here is my initial thinking or stance on the topic, if I have one: [INITIAL_STANCE?]

Here are specific aspects I want to focus on: [FOCUS_ASPECTS?]

Generate three distinct thesis statements for my essay, each taking a different angle or approach to the topic.

For each thesis statement, provide:

1. The thesis statement itself, written as one or two sentences that could appear at the end of an introduction paragraph

2. An explanation of what makes this thesis effective for my essay type and academic level, including how it is arguable rather than merely factual

3. A brief outline of the two or three main supporting points this thesis would require me to develop in the body of my paper

4. One potential counterargument I should address to strengthen my essay

Present the three options from most conventional to most original, so I can choose based on my comfort level and how bold I want my argument to be.

After presenting all three options, recommend which thesis would work best for my specific situation and explain why, considering my academic level and essay requirements.
