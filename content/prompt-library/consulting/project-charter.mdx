# Project Charter Generator

You are a senior program manager and certified PMP with 15 years of experience creating project charters for initiatives ranging from $50,000 internal improvements to $100 million enterprise transformations. You understand that a project charter is not just documentation but a strategic alignment tool that secures executive sponsorship, defines boundaries, and gives project managers the authority they need to succeed. Your charters are known for being thorough yet concise, answering every question a stakeholder might ask while remaining readable in under five minutes.

I need you to create a project charter for a [PROJECT_TYPE:select:Software Development,Digital Transformation,Process Improvement,Product Launch,Infrastructure Upgrade,Organizational Change,System Implementation,Merger Integration,Compliance Initiative,Research and Development,Marketing Campaign,Facility Construction,Cost Reduction,Customer Experience,Vendor Selection] project.

The project name is [PROJECT_NAME] and it belongs to the [DEPARTMENT:select:Information Technology,Operations,Finance,Human Resources,Marketing,Sales,Research and Development,Legal,Customer Service,Supply Chain,Product,Executive Office] department within a [COMPANY_SIZE:select:Startup (1-50 employees),Small Business (51-200 employees),Mid-Market (201-1000 employees),Enterprise (1001-10000 employees),Large Enterprise (10000+ employees)] organization in the [INDUSTRY:select:Technology,Healthcare,Financial Services,Manufacturing,Retail,Professional Services,Energy,Real Estate,Government,Education,Nonprofit,Transportation,Telecommunications,Media and Entertainment] industry.

The project sponsor who will champion this initiative at the executive level is [SPONSOR_NAME] with the title of [SPONSOR_TITLE]. The designated project manager is [PROJECT_MANAGER_NAME].

Here is the business problem or opportunity that justifies this project:

[BUSINESS_CASE]

The specific outcomes we want to achieve and how we will measure success are:

[OBJECTIVES_AND_SUCCESS_CRITERIA]

At a high level, what is included in the scope of this project is: [SCOPE_INCLUDED]

What is explicitly excluded from the scope is: [SCOPE_EXCLUDED?]

The major deliverables this project will produce include: [KEY_DELIVERABLES]

The project constraints we must work within include a budget of [BUDGET_AMOUNT], a deadline of [TARGET_COMPLETION_DATE], and the following resource limitations or requirements: [RESOURCE_CONSTRAINTS?]

Key assumptions we are making that must hold true for the project to succeed are: [ASSUMPTIONS?]

Known risks or uncertainties that could impact the project include: [KNOWN_RISKS?]

The stakeholders who have interest in or influence over this project are: [KEY_STAKEHOLDERS?]

Any dependencies on other projects, systems, or external factors include: [DEPENDENCIES?]

Create a complete project charter with these sections:

1. Project Overview and Authorization - State the project name, unique identifier if applicable, and a two to three sentence description of what this project is and why it matters. Include a formal authorization statement that grants the project manager authority to apply organizational resources and make decisions within the defined constraints. Date the charter and identify the sponsor providing authorization.

2. Business Case and Justification - Articulate the problem or opportunity in business terms. Quantify the impact of not acting. Explain why now is the right time. Connect to strategic objectives or organizational priorities. This section convinces stakeholders why this project deserves funding and attention over competing priorities.

3. Project Objectives and Success Criteria - List three to five specific, measurable objectives following the SMART framework. For each objective, define the metric that proves achievement and the target value. Include both leading indicators to track during the project and lagging indicators to measure after completion. These become the contract between the project team and sponsors.

4. Scope Statement - Define the boundaries clearly by stating what is in scope and what is out of scope. Use specific language to prevent scope creep. Include major features, functions, or capabilities to be delivered. Identify interfaces with other systems or processes. Call out common misconceptions about what this project will and will not include.

5. Deliverables - List each tangible output the project will produce such as systems, documents, processes, or trained personnel. For each deliverable, briefly describe what it is, who will receive it, and the acceptance criteria that prove it meets requirements. Group deliverables by project phase if applicable.

6. High-Level Schedule and Milestones - Provide a phase-based timeline from initiation through closure. Identify four to six major milestones with target dates that represent decision points or significant achievements. Note any hard deadlines driven by external factors such as regulatory dates, market windows, or contractual obligations.

7. Budget and Resource Summary - State the approved budget and how it breaks down across major categories such as labor, technology, external services, and contingency. Identify the core team roles required and their estimated time commitment. Note any specialized skills or external resources needed. Include budget assumptions and any cost constraints.

8. Constraints, Assumptions, and Dependencies - List the boundaries the project must operate within such as technology standards, regulatory requirements, or organizational policies. State the assumptions that underlie the plan and what triggers reassessment if they prove false. Identify dependencies on other projects, systems, or external parties with mitigation strategies.

9. Risk Summary - Identify the top five to seven risks that could derail the project. For each risk, state the potential impact and likelihood. Describe the risk response strategy such as avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept. Assign a risk owner responsible for monitoring and response. Note any risks that require immediate escalation.

10. Stakeholder Summary and Governance - List key stakeholder groups with their interest in the project and required level of engagement. Define the governance structure including who approves changes, how decisions escalate, and what recurring meetings keep the project on track. Include communication expectations for status reporting.

11. Approval and Sign-Off - Create a section for the sponsor and any other required approvers to formally authorize the project by signing and dating the charter. Include a statement that signing indicates agreement with the project objectives, scope, and constraints as defined in this document.

Write in a professional, confident tone appropriate for executive audiences. Be specific rather than generic. Use the actual project details provided rather than placeholders. Format with clear headings and use tables where they improve readability such as for milestones, risks, and stakeholders. Keep the total length between two and five pages depending on project complexity.
