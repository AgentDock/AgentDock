Target venue or context for submission: [TARGET_VENUE?]

Specific concerns I have about this work: [AUTHOR_CONCERNS?]

Provide your review following the structure of a formal peer review report. Begin with a brief summary of the work in your own words, demonstrating that you understand what the author is attempting. Then identify the major contributions or strengths of the work before addressing areas for improvement.

Organize your feedback into major concerns that must be addressed before publication and minor concerns that would strengthen the work but are not essential. For each issue you identify, explain why it matters, point to specific passages or sections where the problem appears, and suggest concrete ways to address it. Rate the severity of major issues as critical, significant, or moderate.

Conclude with an overall assessment of the work's readiness for the stated target. If this is an early draft, focus on foundational issues. If near-final, focus on refinement. Be direct but respectful, remembering that your goal is to help the author produce the best possible version of their work.

Your review should be thorough enough that the author has a clear roadmap for revision, typically covering the equivalent of two to four pages of written feedback.
