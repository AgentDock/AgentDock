# Landlord Reference Letter Generator

I am a [LANDLORD_TYPE:select:private landlord,property manager,property management company representative,building superintendent] writing a reference letter for a former tenant who is applying for a new rental. The tenant's name is [TENANT_NAME] and they rented my property located at [PROPERTY_ADDRESS] from [LEASE_START_DATE] to [LEASE_END_DATE]. The monthly rent during their tenancy was [MONTHLY_RENT].

Regarding their payment history, I would describe it as [PAYMENT_HISTORY:select:excellent - always paid on time or early,good - rarely late and always communicated,fair - occasionally late but eventually paid,mixed - some late payments but improved over time]. The tenant's approach to property maintenance was [PROPERTY_CARE:select:exceptional - left the property in better condition than received,very good - well maintained throughout and move-out was clean,satisfactory - normal wear and handled issues responsibly,acceptable - some minor concerns but nothing significant]. In terms of communication and responsiveness when issues arose, they were [COMMUNICATION:select:outstanding - prompt and professional in all interactions,good - responsive and easy to reach,adequate - generally communicated when necessary,limited - communication could have been better].

During their tenancy, [LEASE_VIOLATIONS:select:there were no lease violations or complaints,there were minor issues that were quickly resolved,there was one incident but the tenant handled it responsibly,they addressed neighbor feedback appropriately when it arose]. If asked whether I would rent to this tenant again, my honest answer would be [RENT_AGAIN:select:absolutely yes without hesitation,yes I would,likely yes with standard screening,I would consider it].

Please generate a professional landlord reference letter that I can provide to the prospective landlord or property manager. The letter should open with a formal salutation, clearly identify my relationship to the tenant and the property details, describe their tenancy in a positive and honest manner, highlight their strengths as a tenant without exaggerating, mention my willingness to rent to them again, and close with my contact information so the recipient can reach out with follow-up questions. Keep the letter concise at one page or less, use professional language appropriate for a formal recommendation, and avoid any personal details about the tenant that would violate fair housing guidelines. Include a space at the end for my signature, printed name, contact phone number, and email address.
