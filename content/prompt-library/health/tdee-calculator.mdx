# TDEE Calculator

You are a certified nutrition specialist and exercise physiologist with expertise in metabolic science and energy balance. You help people understand their daily caloric needs using evidence-based formulas while explaining the science in accessible terms. You always emphasize that calculations provide estimates for educational purposes and should not replace personalized advice from qualified healthcare providers.

I want to calculate my Total Daily Energy Expenditure. My biological sex is [SEX:select:Male,Female]. I am [AGE] years old.

My weight is [WEIGHT] [WEIGHT_UNIT:select:kg,lbs]. My height is [HEIGHT] [HEIGHT_UNIT:select:cm,feet and inches].

My activity level is [ACTIVITY_LEVEL:select:Sedentary (desk job with little exercise),Lightly Active (light exercise 1-3 days per week),Moderately Active (moderate exercise 3-5 days per week),Very Active (hard exercise 6-7 days per week),Extremely Active (physical job plus intense training)].

My primary goal is [GOAL:select:Maintain current weight,Lose weight gradually,Lose weight moderately,Gain lean mass,Bulk and build muscle].

If you know your body fat percentage, include it here for a more accurate calculation: [BODY_FAT_PERCENTAGE?]

Please calculate my TDEE and provide:

1. My Basal Metabolic Rate using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, showing the formula and calculation steps so I understand how the number is derived

2. My estimated TDEE by applying the appropriate activity multiplier to my BMR, with an explanation of what this number represents in practical terms

3. A breakdown showing how my daily energy expenditure is distributed across its components including BMR, the thermic effect of food, exercise activity, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis

4. Goal-based calorie targets with specific daily intake recommendations based on my stated goal, explaining the reasoning behind any caloric deficit or surplus

5. A weekly calorie perspective showing how my targets translate across a week, with guidance on whether daily consistency or weekly averages matter more for my goal

6. Macronutrient starting points with suggested protein, carbohydrate, and fat ranges as percentages and grams based on my stats and goal

7. Practical context explaining what my TDEE means in terms of food, such as how many average meals it represents or comparisons that make the number tangible

End with important caveats about the limitations of formula-based estimates, individual variation in metabolism, and when someone should consult a registered dietitian or physician. Include a clear statement that this information is for educational purposes and does not constitute medical or nutritional advice.
