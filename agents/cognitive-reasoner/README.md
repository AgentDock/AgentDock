# Cognitive Reasoner

The Cognitive Reasoner is an agent designed to tackle complex problems through structured reasoning and reflection. It excels at breaking down problems, exploring multiple solutions, evaluating different approaches, synthesizing information, identifying errors in reasoning, reflecting on experiences, and reconsidering assumptions when necessary.

## Strengths

The agent is particularly effective for:

- **Logical Problem-Solving:** Complex puzzles, logic problems, algorithmic challenges
- **Mathematical Reasoning:** Probability calculations, statistical analyses, numerical estimations
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Considering multiple viewpoints on complex issues
- **Decision Analysis:** Weighing options using structured frameworks
- **Reflection and Insight Extraction:** Analyzing past experiences to derive meaningful lessons
- **Complex Systems Analysis:** Understanding interconnected variables and feedback loops
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Breaking down abstract concepts into understandable components

## Example Test Prompts

The Cognitive Reasoner can be tested with these prompts:

### Structured Thinking (Using the Think Tool)
- **Fermi Estimation:** "How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?"
- **Probability Reasoning:** "Should I switch doors in the Monty Hall problem?"
- **Decision Analysis:** "What factors should I consider when deciding whether to rent or buy a home?"
- **Ethical Dilemma:** "Is it ethical to use generative AI for creative work?"
- **Policy Evaluation:** "What are the potential effects of implementing a universal basic income?"
- **Causal Reasoning:** "What factors explain the global decline in bee populations?"
- **Trade-off Analysis:** "What are the pros and cons of nuclear energy compared to other power sources?"

### Retrospective Analysis (Using the Reflect Tool)
- **Personal Reflection:** "Help me reflect on a recent career decision I made and what I could learn from it"
- **Project Post-mortem:** "Reflect on why most software projects fail to meet their deadlines"
- **Historical Analysis:** "Reflect on the most significant factors that led to the 2008 financial crisis"
- **Learning from Experience:** "Help me analyze what I could learn from a recent negotiation that didn't go well"
- **Pattern Recognition:** "Reflect on common traits among successful startup founders"
- **Team Dynamics:** "Help me reflect on why some teams collaborate effectively while others don't"
- **Decision Review:** "Reflect on how governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and what could be improved"

## Expected Output Pattern

### When Using the Think Tool
1. **Clarification:** Reformulating the problem to ensure understanding
2. **Identification:** Determining key variables and constraints
3. **Approach:** Considering multiple solution methods
4. **Execution:** Applying the chosen approach step-by-step
5. **Verification:** Checking results and acknowledging limitations
6. **Conclusion:** Summarizing findings and providing a clear answer

### When Using the Reflect Tool
1. **Context:** Establishing the background and relevant details
2. **Observation:** Noting patterns, behaviors, and outcomes
3. **Insight:** Extracting meaningful lessons and principles
4. **Growth Areas:** Identifying opportunities for improvement
5. **Connections:** Relating to broader principles or other situations
6. **Action:** Providing actionable takeaways for future application

## Implementation Guidance

For optimal results with the Cognitive Reasoner:

1. **Provide Context:** Include relevant details in your query
2. **Be Specific:** Clarify what kind of reasoning or reflection you're looking for
3. **Request Structure:** For complex problems, explicitly ask for structured thinking or reflection
4. **Engage Iteratively:** Follow up with clarifying questions if needed
5. **Test Assumptions:** Ask the agent to reconsider its initial premises

The Cognitive Reasoner combines analytical thinking with reflective capabilities, making it versatile for both forward-looking problem-solving and retrospective analysis.
