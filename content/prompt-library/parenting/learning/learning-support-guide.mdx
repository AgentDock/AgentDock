I want to better support my child who has learning differences or challenges.

My child is [CHILD_AGE] years old and in [GRADE_LEVEL].

The learning difference or challenge is [LEARNING_DIFFERENCE:select:ADHD - primarily inattentive,ADHD - primarily hyperactive,ADHD - combined type,dyslexia,dysgraphia,dyscalculia,autism spectrum,processing speed issues,executive function challenges,anxiety affecting learning,not formally diagnosed but struggling].

The main areas where they struggle: [STRUGGLE_AREAS]

Their strengths and interests: [STRENGTHS?]

Current supports in place at school: [CURRENT_SUPPORTS?] (such as IEP, 504 plan, tutoring, etc.)

The specific situation I need help with: [SPECIFIC_SITUATION:select:homework struggles,studying for tests,organization and planning,reading comprehension,writing assignments,math concepts,focus and attention,social situations at school,advocating with the school,building confidence].

Provide practical strategies I can use at home to support my child with this specific challenge. Include techniques that work with their brain rather than against it, ways to build on their strengths, how to communicate and advocate with teachers, and how to help them develop self-advocacy skills. Focus on actionable approaches I can start using right away.
