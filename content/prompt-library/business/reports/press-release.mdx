# Press Release Writer

I need to write a press release that announces news and attracts media attention.

The news or announcement is [NEWS_ANNOUNCEMENT].

The type of announcement is [ANNOUNCEMENT_TYPE:select:product or service launch,funding or investment,partnership or collaboration,company milestone,executive hire or change,event announcement,research or study findings,award or recognition,acquisition or merger,expansion or growth].

The company name is [COMPANY_NAME] and we are [COMPANY_DESCRIPTION] (brief one-liner about what the company does).

The location and date for the dateline: [LOCATION_DATE]

Key facts and details to include: [KEY_DETAILS]

A quote from a spokesperson: [QUOTE_SOURCE] (name and title of person to quote)

What they should say or the message of the quote: [QUOTE_MESSAGE]

Additional quotes from partners or customers: [ADDITIONAL_QUOTES?]

Relevant context or background: [CONTEXT?]

The target media outlets or journalists: [TARGET_MEDIA?]

Write a professional press release following standard format: a compelling headline, a subheadline if needed, a strong lead paragraph with who what when where why, supporting paragraphs with details and quotes, company boilerplate, and contact information placeholder. Use AP style. Lead with the most newsworthy angle. Keep it to one page, approximately 400 to 500 words. Make the quote sound natural, not promotional. Write in third person and past or present tense as appropriate.
