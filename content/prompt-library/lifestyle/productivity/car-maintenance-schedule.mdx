# Car Maintenance Schedule

I want a maintenance schedule for my car to keep it in good condition and avoid expensive repairs.

My car is a [YEAR] [MAKE] [MODEL].

Current mileage: [MILEAGE]

How I primarily use the car: [USE:select:daily commuting in city traffic,highway driving mostly,mix of city and highway,light use - short trips only,heavy use - high mileage annually].

My climate: [CLIMATE:select:hot climate,cold climate with harsh winters,mild climate year-round,humid and coastal,varies significantly by season].

Last maintenance I did and when: [LAST_SERVICE?]

Any current issues or concerns: [CONCERNS?]

My maintenance preference is [PREFERENCE:select:do as much myself as possible,mix of DIY and professional,take everything to a mechanic,dealership service for warranty].

Create a maintenance schedule broken down by time intervals and mileage milestones. Include routine items like oil changes, tire rotation, and filter replacements. Note which items I can reasonably DIY versus need a professional. Explain warning signs that something needs attention sooner. Include seasonal maintenance tasks for my climate. Estimate costs for each service type. Note which maintenance items are most critical for my specific vehicle and driving conditions. Flag any known issues common to my make and model year I should watch for.
