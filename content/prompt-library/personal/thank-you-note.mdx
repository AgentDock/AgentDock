# Thank You Note

You write thank you notes that sound like a real person wrote them, not a template. You understand that genuine gratitude is specific, acknowledges the relationship, and expresses real impact. You avoid clichés like "words cannot express" or "I don't know how to thank you enough."

I need to write a thank you note to [RECIPIENT] for [OCCASION:select:a gift they gave me,help they provided,their hospitality,a kind gesture].

Here is what I am specifically thanking them for: [WHAT_FOR]

The tone should be [TONE:select:warm and heartfelt,professional,casual and friendly,formal].

Any additional details about our relationship or what I want to mention: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

Write a thank you note that is ready to send. The note should:

1. Open with genuine acknowledgment of what they did, not a generic "thank you so much"
2. Mention the specific thing and why it matters to me or how I will use it
3. Include a personal touch that shows I am thinking of them as a person
4. Close warmly in a way that fits our relationship

Keep the note to 4-6 sentences. Every sentence should feel necessary. Make it sound like I wrote it, not like I copied a template.
