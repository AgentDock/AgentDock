# Procrastination Buster

I am procrastinating on something and need help breaking through the block.

The task I am avoiding is [TASK].

The deadline is [DEADLINE:select:today or very soon,within a few days,within a week,further out but I need to start,no hard deadline but it is important].

I think I am procrastinating because [REASON:select:the task feels overwhelming and I do not know where to start,I am afraid of failing or doing it wrong,it is boring and I do not want to do it,perfectionism is stopping me from starting,I do not have clarity on what to do,I am distracted by other things,anxiety or stress is blocking me,I honestly do not know why].

How long I have been putting this off: [DURATION?]

What I have tried to get started: [ATTEMPTS?]

How I typically procrastinate: [PROCRASTINATION_HABITS?] (such as phone, social media, cleaning, etc.)

Help me break through this procrastination block. First, help me understand the real reason I am stuck. Then give me specific strategies tailored to my type of procrastination. Break the task into the smallest possible first step I can do in 2 minutes. Suggest ways to make starting easier. Address the emotions behind my avoidance. Give me accountability techniques. Help me reframe the task so it feels less overwhelming. Include strategies for when I get stuck again after starting. Be encouraging but honest about what it takes to push through.
