# DIY Project Planner

I want to tackle a DIY project and need guidance on how to do it right.

The project I want to do is: [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]

My DIY experience level is [EXPERIENCE:select:complete beginner,some basic experience,fairly handy,experienced DIYer].

Tools I already have: [TOOLS?]

My budget for this project is [BUDGET:select:as cheap as possible,moderate - willing to buy what I need,flexible for quality results].

Timeframe I have available: [TIME:select:a few hours,a full day,a weekend,flexible - can work on it over time].

Space or area where I will be working: [SPACE?]

Create a complete project plan including a materials and tools list with quantities, step-by-step instructions for each phase, estimated time for each step, safety considerations and precautions, tips for getting professional-looking results, common mistakes to avoid, and how to know when to call a professional instead. Include photos or videos I should look up for techniques that are hard to describe. Note any steps where I should pause and let things dry or cure. Suggest ways to save money without sacrificing quality.
