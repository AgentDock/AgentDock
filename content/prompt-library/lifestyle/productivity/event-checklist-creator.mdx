# Event Checklist Creator

I need a detailed checklist for an upcoming event so nothing falls through the cracks.

The event is [EVENT_DESCRIPTION].

The date is [DATE] and I have [TIME_UNTIL:select:less than a week,1-2 weeks,3-4 weeks,1-2 months,more than 2 months] to prepare.

The scale is [SCALE:select:small and intimate,medium sized,large event,very large or professional level].

I am [ROLE:select:the main or only planner,part of a planning team,hiring vendors to handle most of it,a mix of DIY and vendors].

Key vendors or helpers involved: [VENDORS?]

Specific elements I know I need to include: [ELEMENTS?]

My biggest worry about this event: [CONCERNS?]

Create a comprehensive checklist organized by timeline, from now until the day of the event. Break it into categories like venue, catering, decorations, entertainment, communications, and logistics. Include often-forgotten details that catch people off guard. Add checkpoints for confirming bookings and following up with vendors. Include a separate day-before and day-of checklist with times. Note items that have dependencies so I know what order to tackle things. Flag decisions that need to be made by certain dates. Include a post-event wrap-up checklist if applicable.
