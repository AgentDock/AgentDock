# Session Management

This directory contains documentation about AgentDock's session management system.

## Overview

Sessions in AgentDock provide isolation between concurrent conversations and maintain state across multiple requests. They are a critical part of the architecture that enables:

- Stateful conversations with LLM agents
- Tool context persistence
- Orchestration state management
- Memory efficiency and resource optimization
