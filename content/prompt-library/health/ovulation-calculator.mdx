# Ovulation Calculator

I need help calculating my fertile window and ovulation dates. The first day of my last menstrual period was [FIRST_DAY_OF_LAST_PERIOD] and my typical cycle length is [CYCLE_LENGTH:number:21-40] days. My cycles are [CYCLE_REGULARITY:select:Very regular (same length each month),Fairly regular (varies by 1-3 days),Somewhat irregular (varies by 4-7 days),Irregular (varies significantly)].

Please provide my estimated ovulation date and fertile window for the next three cycles. Include the science behind the calculations, explaining how the fertile window is determined based on ovulation timing and the lifespan of sperm and egg. List physical signs of ovulation I can monitor, such as changes in cervical mucus, basal body temperature shifts, and other common indicators.

If my cycles are irregular, explain how this affects the reliability of calendar-based predictions and suggest additional tracking methods like ovulation predictor kits or basal body temperature charting that could improve accuracy.

I would also like guidance on [ADDITIONAL_INTEREST:select:maximizing chances of conception,understanding my natural fertility patterns,timing for family planning purposes,tracking for health awareness].

Please include appropriate disclaimers that these are estimates based on averages and that individual cycles may vary. Note that this information is for educational purposes and recommend consulting a healthcare provider for personalized fertility guidance, especially for those with conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders that can affect ovulation patterns.
