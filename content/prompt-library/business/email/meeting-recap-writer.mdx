# Meeting Recap Email Writer

I need to write a recap email summarizing a meeting and its outcomes.

The meeting was about [MEETING_TOPIC].

The attendees were [ATTENDEES].

The meeting type was [MEETING_TYPE:select:project status update,brainstorming session,decision-making meeting,kickoff meeting,client call,team sync,one-on-one,all-hands or department meeting,interview debrief,vendor or partner meeting].

Here are my rough notes from the meeting: [MEETING_NOTES]

The key decisions made were: [DECISIONS?]

The action items are: [ACTION_ITEMS?]

The open questions or items for follow-up are: [OPEN_ITEMS?]

The next steps or next meeting date: [NEXT_STEPS?]

Write a clear, well-organized meeting recap email. Include a subject line that captures the meeting purpose. Structure the recap with the key discussion points, decisions made, action items with owners and due dates if mentioned, and next steps. Keep the tone [TONE:select:professional and formal,friendly but professional,concise and to the point]. Make sure anyone who missed the meeting could understand what happened and what they need to do.
