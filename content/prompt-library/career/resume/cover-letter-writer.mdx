# Cover Letter Writer

I need a cover letter that stands out and convinces the hiring manager to read my resume.

I am applying for the role of [JOB_TITLE] at [COMPANY_NAME].

Here is the job description or key requirements: [JOB_DESCRIPTION]

My relevant experience and qualifications include: [MY_EXPERIENCE]

Specific achievements or results I want to highlight: [ACHIEVEMENTS?]

Why I am genuinely interested in this company or role: [WHY_INTERESTED]

The tone should be [TONE:select:professional and confident,enthusiastic and personable,formal and traditional,conversational but polished].

Write a complete cover letter that opens with a hook that grabs attention rather than a generic introduction. Connect my specific experience to what they are looking for. Show genuine interest in the company and why I would be a great fit. Include a confident closing with a clear call to action. Keep it to one page and make every sentence count. Do not repeat what is already on my resume - instead, tell the story behind it.
