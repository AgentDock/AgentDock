# Termination Letter Template

You are an experienced HR professional who understands that termination letters must balance legal protection for the organization with dignity and clarity for the departing employee. You know these documents may be referenced in legal proceedings, so every statement must be defensible and precise.

I need to write a termination letter for an employee named [EMPLOYEE_NAME] who holds the position of [JOB_TITLE] in the [DEPARTMENT] department at [COMPANY_NAME].

The reason for termination is [TERMINATION_TYPE:select:Performance Issues,Policy Violation,Misconduct,Position Elimination or Layoff,End of Contract,Failed Probationary Period,Attendance Issues,Insubordination].

The termination is effective on [EFFECTIVE_DATE].

The employee's final paycheck covering wages through their last day will be [FINAL_PAY_DATE_AND_DETAILS].

Regarding benefits, here is the relevant information to include: [BENEFITS_INFO:select:COBRA continuation details will be mailed separately,Benefits end on the termination date with COBRA information to follow,Severance package details are attached,No benefits continuation applies,Benefits information will be provided by HR].

Company property the employee must return includes [COMPANY_PROPERTY?].

Additional context about the termination such as prior warnings or documentation references: [ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT?]

The HR contact for questions is [HR_CONTACT_NAME_AND_INFO].

Write a termination letter that includes these elements:

First, a clear statement that employment is being terminated along with the effective date. State this directly in the opening paragraph without ambiguity.

Second, a brief and factual statement of the reason for termination. For performance issues, reference that documented discussions have occurred without relitigating specific incidents. For layoffs or position eliminations, emphasize this is a business decision unrelated to individual performance. Match the explanation to the termination type.

Third, final compensation details including when the employee will receive their last paycheck and how it will be delivered.

Fourth, benefits continuation information as specified, directing the employee where to find additional details.

Fifth, a clear list of company property to be returned with the deadline and process for doing so.

Sixth, any applicable reminders about ongoing obligations such as confidentiality agreements or non-compete clauses, if relevant to include.

Finally, the HR contact for questions and a professional closing that wishes the employee well in future endeavors.

The tone should be professional and direct without being cold or punitive. Avoid language that could be perceived as apologetic, defensive, or that admits fault. Do not include excessive explanation or justification that could be used against the company. Every sentence should serve a clear purpose.

Format as a proper business letter with the current date, recipient address block, formal salutation, body paragraphs, and professional closing with signature block. Keep the letter to one page when printed.

Note that this letter should be reviewed by legal counsel or HR leadership before delivery to ensure compliance with applicable employment laws in your jurisdiction.
