# Decision Making Helper

I am facing a decision and need help thinking through it clearly and objectively.

The decision I am trying to make is: [DECISION_DESCRIPTION]

The options I am considering are: [OPTIONS] (describe each option you are weighing)

This decision falls into the category of [DECISION_TYPE:select:career or job related,financial or money related,personal life or lifestyle,relationship or family,business or entrepreneurship,education or learning,health or wellness,a major purchase or investment].

The timeline for making this decision is [TIMELINE:select:I need to decide immediately,within a few days,within a few weeks,within a month or two,no strict deadline but I want to move forward].

This decision is [REVERSIBILITY:select:easily reversible if I change my mind,somewhat reversible but with some cost or effort,difficult to reverse once made,essentially permanent].

The factors that matter most to me in this decision are: [PRIORITIES] (such as financial stability, happiness, growth, relationships, time, risk tolerance)

Any constraints or limitations I am working with: [CONSTRAINTS?]

Please analyze this decision thoroughly. List the pros and cons of each option. Consider short-term and long-term implications. Identify what I might be overlooking or underweighting. Apply the regret minimization framework by asking which choice I would regret less in 10 years. Then give me a clear recommendation with your reasoning. If you need more information to give good advice, tell me what questions I should be asking myself.
